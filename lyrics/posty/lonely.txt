Lonely

[Jaden Smith & Teo:]

Oh... (oh)

Oh... (nah, nah, nah)

Oh... (oh)

I just...

Can I...

I just...

I just, can I...

I just...

Can I...

I just, I just

Can I, I just

I just want to see you (Damn)

Something I can see through baby (Man)

You make my dreams come true

Can I...

Can I (Aw Yeah), I just




[Post Malone:]

I just

Baby can I come and see you

I just, I just

Girl you seem always on the move

Baby

I just cannot, uh, figure out what to do

And I just, I just, uh, cannot let you go on your own

Eh, why you got to be so inconsiderate wit' it

Know that you mean more than any one of these bitches

Its like you wanna see me go and hop off some bridges

Emo pussy woulda' gone and cut up ones wrists

Instead I'm going to drop a hundred bands on a whip

Only way I know to get my brain off of shit, eh

I just want to see you, maybe talk about shit

I just want to see ya, you might feel for the kid

It's you that I have been searchin' for

Just let me know what's good with y'all

Can't keep on going back and forth

Won't let you, won't let you




[Jaden Smith:]

I just...

I just...

I just want to see you (Damn)

Something I can see through baby (Man)

You're making my dreams come true (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)

Can I...

Can I...

Cause I just want to see you (Hey)

Something I can see through baby

You make my dreams come true (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)



I just, can I

I just...

I just...

Can I come and see you

I just, something I can see through baby, I just

Make my dreams come true (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)

You're walking alone, you're walking alone

I hate when you walk, at least talk on the phone

There's some creeps in this zone, you said joker shut up I should know how to walk

I come from the bronx, I said baby its cool you know I like your talk

We keepin' it cool, we keepin it, keep it



I just...

I just, I just want to see you (Damn)

Something I can see through baby (Man)

You're making my dreams come true (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)

Can I...

Can I...

Cause I just want to see you (Hey)

Something I can see through baby

You make my dreams come true (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah)

Imma' never be alone

Imma' never be alone

When you're walkin' down the road
