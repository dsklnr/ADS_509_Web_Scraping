(Ah-ah, ah-ah)

La-la, la-la

La-la, la-la (Yeah)



Met her at a party

She drove a red Ferrari

When we went to get naughty

Didn't care I was steppin' over bodies



Some might say, some might say

I found a new religion

Some might say, some might say

I made a bad decision

Said you could have my heart

If I'm good when the rapture starts



You sold me

There's no way that I could resist it (La, la)

Control me

It's startin' to sound realistic (La, la)

If you think I have a soul to save

I might have a little faith

Take that shit for a ride

You sold me

If your love is a cult, then I'm in it (Sign me up)



I couldn't see it coming

There ain't no point in running

I'll even cut off all my hair and change my clothes

Ain't even call my mother

For love, you gotta suffer

I'm gettin' pretty good at doin' what I'm told



Some might say, some might say

I found a new religion

Some might say, some might say

I made a bad decision

Said you could have my heart (My heart)

If I'm good when the rapture starts



You sold me

There's no way that I could resist it (La, la)

Control me

It's startin' to sound realistic (La, la)

If you think I have a soul to save

But I knew the party was over

When she tried to take my alcohol



You sold me

There's no way that I could resist it (La, la)

Control me

It's startin' to sound realistic (La, la, sign me up)

If you think I have a soul to save

I might have a little faith

Take that shit for a ride (For a ride)

You sold me

If your love is a cult, then I'm in it (Sign me up)



La-la, la-la
