Hide My Gun

Thirty-eight dollars for a coconut rum, you never looked prettier sippin' on one

These downtown lights are turnin' back off 'cause the world is turnin' back on

Mm-mm, mm-mm

On the same damn road we drove a thousand times

I swear I saw a message in them white and yellow lines

And I ain't sayin' I'm a killer or if I'll ever be, but hypothetically



Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?

Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?

If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door

Would you stall and let me slip out the back?

Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to that never-endin'-honeymoon Mexico sun?

'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya

And if I did, would you hide my gun?

Would you hide my gun?



If you had to dig a hole, would you take it to the grave?

Put some concrete shoes at the bottom of a lake

If I shot him dead would you shoot me straight?

Yeah, shoot me straight



Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?

Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?

If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door

Would you stall and let me slip out the back?

Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to a never-endin'-honeymoon Mexico sun?

'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya

And if I did, would you hide my gun?

Would you hide my gun?



A big wheel gun in my right hand, tiny diamond in my left

Are you down to go the distance, Lord, in sickness and in health?

'Cause nothin' gonna part us

Not even death



Would you hide my gun? Would you tell no one?

Would you pack a never-comin'-back-again bag?

If the three-times-four's bangin' at our door

Would you stall and let me slip out the back?

Girl, if you wanted to, could you get to runnin' to that never-endin'-honeymoon Mexico sun?

'Cause you know I adore ya, no shit, I'd kill a man for ya

And if I did, would you hide my gun?

Would you hide my gun?



Lord, I didn't do anything wrong

I'm only askin' just because
