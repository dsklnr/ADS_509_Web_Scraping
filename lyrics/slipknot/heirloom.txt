Heirloom

When the beating hearts make the beating start, it means they've found you out

Nothing hurts you more until you can't ignore- it's something to cry about

Now before you know it, the scars begin to show it- no place where you feel safe

So much for getting better, it's just a matter... of when- to run- away



A moment never lasts that long

A moment never lasts so long right now

No matter how the past has gone

You'll always have the past along for a lifetime now

But you can't run to ground

You can't run to ground



When the hurting stops and the voices drop, it means the guilt kicks in

They say they didn't mean it- they say they're gonna fix it

When they yell it means they care- aren't you getting it?

Staring daggers, pressing kisses, hiding bruises

When exactly does this feel like love?

Now the question begs, when you're the one who hates...

What in the hell are you passing on?



A moment never lasts that long

A moment never lasts so long right now

No matter how the past has gone

You'll always have the past along... to last a lifetime now



But you can't run to ground

You can't run to ground

A moment never lasts that long

A moment never lasts so long right now

No matter how the past has gone

You'll always have to pass a lifetime now

A moment never lasts that long

A moment never lasts so long right now

No matter how the past has gone

You'll always have the past along... to last a lifetime now
