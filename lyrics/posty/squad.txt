Squad

[Intro - Post Malone:]

A double cup up for my bitches who on the floor shaking they ass, whoa

Bring it on over but baby forgive me if I took the grab, oh

I'm rocking off white with the camo I'm spilling Ciroc on my Ablo

I'm trying to fuck with some millions I promise won't stop till I have em'




[Verse - Post Malone:]

Air Jordans to the ripped jeans I'm in all black with my gold teeth

Put the OG in the codeine your bitch she so thirsty

Said "Oh Lambo Mercy" fuck the police tryna search me

Smoke JUJU tryna curse me

Fuck any motherfucker tryna hurt me

Get smart, quick unzip way too much zip

Undid zip too much zip

Man, fuck out my business

Young Post get the bills quick

Gold chains young white Slick Rick

Boy graining my new whip

Drink 40s till I feel sick




[Hook - Post Malone:]

I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs

I got bars on bars on bars

ARs, and a bad bitch in my car

I'm a do it for my squad

I'm a do it for my squad

Bitch I do it for my squad

Bitch I do it for my squad

Bitch I'm a do it for my squad

Bitch I do it for my squad

Bitch I do it for my squad

Bitch I do it for my squad
