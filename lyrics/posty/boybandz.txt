Boy Bandz

[Intro x2:]

I got N'Sync dancing on my neck

And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check

Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass

So pretty 'lil momma come away

(Come away, come away, come away)

Baby bye bye bye

Baby bye bye bye

I got N'Sync dancing on my neck

And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check

Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass

Pretty 'lil momma come away

(Come away, come away, come away)

Baby bye bye bye

Baby bye bye bye




[Hook x2:]

I got N'Sync dancing on my neck

And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check

Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass

Pretty 'lil momma come away

I got N'Sync dancing on my neck

And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check

Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass

Pretty 'lil momma come away




[Verse:]

Ay

Young motherfucker swing my gold

Everybody act like they know

Everybody want to do the most

I don't do balmains no more

And tell that motherfucker pour more

I spill ghost blood on my coat

Might rock Moncler when I'm cold

Goddamn that's a whole 'lotta dough

Got them Backstreet Boys, ay

Lot of change but I swear I ain't ever change

And I might pull up in a Mercedes

With 16 gold teeth in my face

And you know if I want it I'm a get it

And if I owe you something I'm a pay it

If you want to say something then say it

If you want to try the jewels, make my day




[Hook:]

I got N'Sync dancing on my neck

And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check

Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass

So pretty 'lil momma come away
