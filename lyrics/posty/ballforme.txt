[Post Malone:]

Woah



Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now

Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'



Ball for me

B-ball for me, yeah

I'm on the road, I'm gettin' paid, like what you want, baby? (What you want, baby?)

You're bougie, baby, but I love you, baby, give you the world, baby (you the world, baby)

Paid five grand for a handbag, that's Saint Laurent (Saint Laurent, baby)

Damn, you love that money, baby (oh-oh-oh)

Hunnid thousand plus hunnid thousand, my whip (my whip, my whip)

30 thousand plus 30 thousand, my wrist (my wrist, my wrist)

We got alcohol plus bad bitches, that's lit (that's lit, that's lit)

I swear baby, we was just kissin', that's it (that's it, that's it)

How could I forget the shit that you done done for me? (For me)

Baby gonna take the charge and take the fall for me (for me)

Would love to take you shoppin', but girl, I'll be on tour

Sorry, lil' mama, I can't give you more



Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now

I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down

Could you? I got too much on my mind right now

Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'



Ball for me

B-ball for me, yeah

Ball for me

[Nicki Minaj:]

Yo, gotta hit him on the jack

When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?

Everything is intact

Could have been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack

Pretty much, ain't got a clue

Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do

But I'm still droppin' jaws

Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards

Back to you, I'm so into you

For real, bread like I'm kin to you

If you a 10, I add 10 to you

They be mad when I tend to you

That's what the bae like

Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like

These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight

These niggas wanna know what it tastes like

What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo

They wanna know what it tastes like, yo

All this ice, it should taste like snow

Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo

Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me?

Baby could you? I got too much on my mind right now
