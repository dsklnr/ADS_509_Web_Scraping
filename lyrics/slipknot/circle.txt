Circle

Give me the dust of my father

Stand on the face of the ancients

Bare the secret flesh of time itself



Follow me (follow me)

I've come so far, I'm behind again

Follow me (follow me)

I wish so hard I'm there again

Follow me (follow me)

Follow me (follow me)



All that I wanted were things I had before

All that I needed I never needed more

All of my questions are answers to my sins

All of my endings are waiting to begin



I know the way but I falter

I can't be afraid of my patience

There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe



Follow me (follow me)

I've seen so much I'm blind again

Follow me (follow me)

I feel so bad I'm alive again

Follow me (follow me)



All that I wanted were things I had before (Oh, oh)

All that I needed, I never needed more (Oh, oh)

All of my questions are answers to my sins (Oh, oh)

All of my endings are waiting to begin
