Hateful

You rushing cigarettes, you light a fire got me coughing on my heart

Yeah, you the type to try and throw my ass in jail just because I was alive



Honey, you ain't no angel

You know loving is fatal

You get off on betrayal

I guess we are the same though

We could've taken this shit all the way to Mars if we just played our parts

But



Love is fucking hateful, hateful

Why is it you want me dead

Calling me unfaithful, faithful

But you know who you dealing with

How am I supposed to lay low, lay low

When things are so beyond repair

Love is fucking hateful, hateful to say



You should know that she was just another face, I was tryna get a taste

Put yourself inside my shoes, don't you say I need you to give me space



Honey, you ain't no angel

You know loving is fatal

You get off on betrayal

I guess we are the same though

Maybe shit would be a little different, babe, if I kept my ass in place

But



Love is fucking hateful, hateful

Why is it you want me dead

Calling me unfaithful, faithful

But you know who you dealing with

How am I supposed to lay low, lay low

When things are so beyond repair

Love is fucking hateful, hateful to say



You said that I can't hold you, I can't hold you down

Yeah, always live in overdrive and then it's over

You said that you can't hold me, you can't hold me down

You said



Love is fucking hateful, hateful

Why is it you want me dead

Calling me unfaithful, faithful

But you know who you dealing with

How am I supposed to lay low, lay low

When things are so beyond repair

Love is fucking hateful, hateful to say
