Buyer Beware

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

Mm-mm



It's been a while since I burned incense

I use my lighter for a pack of twenty

I don't know where the fuck my Bible went

But I'm sure they'll forgive me



So please don't burn a hole in me

I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need

No one knows you better than yourself



So don't worry

You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle

Sorry

Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all

So let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone

You're your own oracle, it's just a fucking poem

Sorry

Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all



So many restaurants in Beverly Hills

My favorite dinner comes in packs of twenty-four

I came home through the windowsill

But I'm sure that she'll forgive me



So please don't burn a hole in me

I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need

No one knows you better than yourself



So don't worry

You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle

Sorry

Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all

So let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone

You're your own oracle, it's just a fucking poem

Sorry

Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all



Let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone (Wrote in stone)

You're your own oracle, it's just a fucking poem

Sorry

Baby, I don't have the answers, shit, and maybe I know nothing at all
