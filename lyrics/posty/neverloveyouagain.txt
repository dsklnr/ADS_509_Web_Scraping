Never Love You Again

There's a bad moon hangin' over the city

I can't hear no hymns on the wind

As I pour up that glass of "Forget Me"

Hungover off what could've been



It's a long-lost highway

And this road ain't my friend

I'll love you 'til tomorrow

Then I'll never love you again



Saw the Bible on your dresser

Save some forgiveness for me

Baby, this ain't no old cowboy western

'Cause I won't be lookin' back when I leave



Oh, it's a long-lost highway

And this road ain't my friend

I'll love you 'til tomorrow

Then I'll never love you again



It's a long-lost highway

And this road ain't my friend

I'll love you 'til tomorrow

Then I'll never love you again



Girl, I'll never love you

Again
