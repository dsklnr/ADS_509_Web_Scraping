Yours

I don't know who you are, but one day, I'm going to

And it's gonna break my heart when she gives hers to you

And it won't be tomorrow, but it's gonna be too soon

When I walk her down that aisle and do what daddies have to do



And she might be wearin' white, but her first dress, it was pink

She might be your better half, yeah, but she's my everything

We'll both love her forever, but I loved her long before

And one day, I know I'll give her away

Buddy, that don't mean she's yours



Yesterday, she said her first word, she's a long way from "I do"

Right now, she runs to me, one day, she'll run to you

And it's gonna be your best day, but it's gonna be my worst

You might watch her walkin' towards you, but I saw her walkin' first



And she might be wearin' white, but her first dress, it was pink

She might be your better half, man, but she's my everything

We'll both love her forever, but I loved her long before

And one day, I know I'll give her away

Buddy, that don't mean she's yours



'Cause she's still my little girl

It's crazy thinkin' one day, she'll be someone else's world



And she might be wearin' white, but her first dress, it was pink

She might be your better half, but to me, she's everything

And we'll both love her forever, but I loved her long before

And one day, I know I'll give her away

Buddy, that don't mean she's yours



Even if she takes your last name

Buddy, that don't mean she's yours
