Devil I've Been

She tried to hide them wings under that Double RL

Well, she might be an angel, that's what I'm tellin' myself

And she knows I'm a demon, she heard 'bout all my songs

Saint Hank up on the wall, that man done

Seen it all



Thank God there's still salvation

For a guy like me who still needs savin'



So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in

Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends

Yeah, I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin

Girl, I'm one hell of a night

Yeah, but I ain't the devil I've been



Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (Ain't the devil I've been)

Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been



I've been around the world twice

One foot from six feet deep

I got some burns from a flame I thought could never get me

And wouldn't you know

She fell right through the roof of the bar where I met

Yeah, and pulled up a stool



Thank God there's still salvation

For a guy like me who still needs savin'



So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in

Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends

Yeah, I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin

Girl, I'm one hell of a night

Yeah, but I ain't the devil I've been



Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (Oh, the devil I've been)

Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been



Oh, I ain't the flame I used to be

Yeah, it's funny how a cage can make a man feel so free



So I hung my horns on the wall soon as she walked in

Been in here gettin' half gone with all my hell-bound friends (Hell-bound friends)

Yeah, I'm about tired of livin' this life of sin

Girl, I'm one hell of a night

Yeah, but I ain't the devil I've been



Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (Oh, I ain't the devil I've been)

Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (Oh, I ain't the devil I've been)

Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (Oh, I ain't the devil I've been)

Ain't the devil, ain't the devil, ain't the devil I've been (I ain't the devil I've been)
