M-E-X-I-C-O

I was hangin' 'round in Brooklyn town with a settle-down type girl

Her daddy was a diplomat who thought he ruled the world

And he was well-connected, he helped me connect the dots

He paid me off to leave, and let's just say he paid a lot



I guess it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me

Laid up in the shade of a coconut tree

And love said, "Go to hell," but there's somewhere I'd rather be

So it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me



So I took her daddy's money, but I stopped in Vegas first

I met a dancer on the strip and fell in love with her

We almost tied the knot when Elvis asked, "Any objections?"

Her mobster boyfriend busted in with an AK-47



Guess it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me

Laid up in the shade of a coconut tree

And love said, "Go to hell," but there's somewhere I'd rather be

So it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me



I made it south of El Paso, met a businesswoman there

I knew that she was rich, but how, I didn't care

When the cops kicked in the door, they found a suitcase of cocaine

She took off with the Federale, and I took all the blame



I guess it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me

From this jail cell, I can't see one coconut tree

And love said, "Go to hell," and now I can't ever leave

So it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me

So it's M-E-X-I-C-O for me
