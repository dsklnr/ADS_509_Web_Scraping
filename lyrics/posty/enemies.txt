Enemies

Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me

Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



They said I would never get this far

Think that we don't see who you are, are, are

Laughing to the bank, like ha, ha, ha

That's it, I'm just talking too much, blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)



So, where did y'all go

When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes

Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show

She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh



I know it's hard to swallow your pride

Sorry that you can't get over me

Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I



Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me

Money tend to show all their tendencies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



Sometimes, every time they let me down

Sometimes, every time they let me down

Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



Close to my enemies (Let's go)

I need better energy (Huh)

When I told you, "Fuck you", you thought I was playin', huh? (Yeah, yeah)

But I meant that shit literally

She wanted to vibe, but I told her fuck that (Nope)

She looked at me like she surprised

The pack in the post and I'm home alone, 

When the box hit the door, they go for 35

I try to put on for my partners they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye

You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist, give a nigga a quarter pound without the fries

I just went double platinum with no features just to show a nigga I don't really need him

Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake, it's guaranteed to fold and bite the hand that feed him

And I know you think that I ain't see it

And I know you bitch ain't got a car, don't make me go and buy a bitch a little Prius

Fuck her on the camera, we can call it even

Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'

And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag

Tie them bitches up and leave 'em

'Cause most of these niggas are decievin'

And I



Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me

Money tend to show all their tendencies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



Sometimes, every time they let me down

Sometimes, every time they let me down

Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



It's too late to turn this shit around

Only held me down when you wanted me to drown

It's too late to turn this shit around

So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now



Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me

Money tend to show all they tendencies

Enemies, yeah, so sad



Sometimes, every time they let me down

Sometimes, every time they let me down

Used to have friends, now I got enemies

Ooh

It's too late

It's too late
