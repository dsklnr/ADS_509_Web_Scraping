Gently

Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing mode of pleasure

A pleasure that will take my mind off of the realities of my life

My past life



Life as I know it now

And whatever may come

It slowly disappears to somewhere in the back of my mind

It will remain there 'til I wish to retrieve it



Yes, I will stay here for awhile

For I need a break

A break from the pressures of life

And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands



This mode is incredible

It's out of this world

Too bad I must always leave it

Oh, but that's life (That's life)



That's life (That's life)

That's life (That's life)

That's life (That's life)
