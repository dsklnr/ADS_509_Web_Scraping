Guy For That

I got a guy to sight in my rifle

My mama's new boyfriend re-binds Bibles

Ricky down the road, he re-souls Red Wings, hell

I got a guy for every damn thing

Oh, that ain't exactly what I'm lookin' for

'Cause I'm lookin' for



Someone to put her tires back into drive

And if they don't, then I just might

Lose what's left of my never lovin' mind

I'm damn near down, to my last dime

I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart

But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part

She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back

But I ain't got a guy for that



Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy for that



Know a V.I.P. up at M.I.T.

And he still won't let me fly the time machine

Someone to turn back the hands on my new A.P.

But, buddy, what I really need



Is someone to put her tires back into drive

And if they don't, then I just might

Lose what's left of my never lovin' mind

I'm damn near down, to my last dime

I'm pretty good at breakin' down a heart

But pickin' up the pieces is the hard part

She's searchin' for someone who's gonna build it back

But I ain't got a guy for that



Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy

I ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy for that

Ain't got a guy

I ain't got a guy for that
