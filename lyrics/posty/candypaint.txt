Candy Paint

Yeah, yeah, mmm



Candy paint with the white on top

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, That's SWAT, you thot

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whip, same price my watch

Got no jumper but I ball a lot

Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want

Candy paint with the white on top (skrrt)

Lambo doors are the oo-op drop (drop)

If you busy plotting on what I got

Kick in your door, that's SWAT, you thot (pop)

Hundred thousand dollars on the table top

Half price my whip, same price my watch (bling)

Got no jumper but I ball a lot (swish)

Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I want



Didn't know that was your girl when she gave me top (yuh)

Kicked her out the Rolls said, "Thanks a lot"

Goddamn I love paper like I'm Michael Scott (yeah)

I can do things that your man cannot (yeah)

Slide boy comin' down, damn, I'm hot (hot)

Everybody say that I gotta be stopped (stopped)

Even though my final form ain't unlocked (locked)

I'm so ahead of you motherfuckers

How you comprehend what you ain't understanding?

Count a hundred bands and I watch it vanish

Diamonds going crazy like they on the dance floor

Got a lot of ass, nothing I can't handle



Flavor lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn)

Baby, I'm the boss like I'm Tony Danza (Tony Danza)

Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for

But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (aye)

I've been rolling twenty ash, hit the road (wooh)

Hit the switch up the suicide doors (damn)

We already know you vanished though (ooh)

Hit my momma when I ride in that, oh

All these motherfuckers so false with me (yah)

If your money funny, don't talk to me (nah)

I know there ain't shit that you could offer me (no)

Take a second if you think about crossing me



It lasts forever, you should try a sample (God damn)

Everybody trying to tell me what I stand for (what I stand for)

But you don't fucking know me, homie, you don't want war (you don't want war)
