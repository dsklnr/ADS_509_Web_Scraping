Killers Are Quiet

Cycle of life and death supposedly

Goes 'round and 'round yet it stops with me

Glorious hunters of my faith, I have sinned

Killers are quiet like the breath of the wind



Filling the shadows with forms of my own

Raised by kindred of Get I was born

Abomination world in disarray

Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae



Reflection beckons a portal shard

Spiritual quest I must stay on guard

Stepping sideways between worlds I shift

Killers are quiet when they're born with the gift



Beautiful anguish cast out by my race

Now one that's ageless I save my own face

I write my own laws with death, I break bread

Killers are quiet when they come from my head!



Run! Run! Run! Run!

Run! Run! Run! Run!
