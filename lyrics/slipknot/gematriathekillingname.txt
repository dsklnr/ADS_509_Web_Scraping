Gematria (The Killing Name)

12/08/73, that was all I got, and now you got me

All I ever really wanted was to take the blame

I will go down in history and not down in flames

Meningitis, I will survive this

Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis

The Time of the Nine has begun

Get out of the way or you will suffer as one

Oh, this is so typical, apocalyptical

Hanging on abysmal release, Jesus

I don't need this, don't wanna be this

Icon in the making, my hands are fucking shaking



What if God doesn't care?

What if God doesn't care?



Remember, surrender

The time is now

Continue, we're in you

And we will burn your cities down



America is a killing name

It doesn't feel or discriminate

Life is just a killing field

It's all that's left, nothing's real

Throw away your disposable past

And fall apart like a cigarette ash

We are the fatal and vital ones of the world

And we will burn your cities down



What if God doesn't care?

What if God doesn't care?



Oh



America is a killing name

It doesn't feel or discriminate

Life is just a killing field

It's all that's left, nothing's real

Throw away your disposable past

And fall apart like a cigarette ash

We are the fatal and vital ones of the world

And we will burn your cities down



Down, ha

We will burn your cities down

We will burn your cities down

Yeah, we will burn your cities down



Feed the hungry, feed them shit

Feed them bones and politics

You wanna revolutionize?

Be specific and believe your eyes

Start a war in another backyard

And we'll destroy your house of cards

Give me a minute and I'll change your mind

Give me a bullet and I'll change your life



Remember, surrender

The time is now

Continue, we're in you

And we will burn your cities down



America is a killing name

It doesn't feel or discriminate

Life is just a killing field

It's all that's left, nothing's real

Throw away your disposable past

And fall apart like a cigarette ash

We are the fatal and vital ones of the world

And we will burn your cities down



Down, down

We will burn your cities down

Down, down

We will burn your cities down



America, what if God doesn't care?

What if God doesn't care?
