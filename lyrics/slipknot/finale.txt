Finale

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day

But I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day

But I like it here (I like it here)

I like it here



The sentiment, the sad things

The punishments, the bad things

The cellular, the solenoid

The outer reach, the inner void

I keep repeating older answers

The questions are all brand-new

Does the room seem smaller these days?

Does the road seem long to you?

The accidents, the bitter pills

The populace, the stronger wills

The innocence, the common sense

The rare occasions... exist



I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day

But I like it here (I like it here)



Oh, I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day

But I like it here (I like it here)



The harder work, the darker thoughts

The ultimatums, the tangled knots

The long depressions, the shorter fuse

Denominator is you



Everybody has a cross to bear

I'll nail you up on mine

Couldn't tell you, don't know where to begin

Won't crumble, not this time



I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day

But I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay (Stay)

'Cause I like it here (I like it here)

I know it's the same, it happens every day (Every day)

But I like it here (I like it here)

I like it here
