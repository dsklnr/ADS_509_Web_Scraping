Purity

Maze

Psychopathic daze

I create this waste

Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways

Can't escape this place

I deny your face

Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying



Put me in a homemade cellar

Put me in a hole for shelter

Someone hear me please

All I see is hate

I can hardly breathe

And I can hardly take it



Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't



Lost

Ran at my own cost

Hearing laughter, scoffed

Learning from the rush

Detached from such and such

Bleak

All around me, weak

Listening, incomplete

I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging



I am in a buried kennel

I have never felt so final

Someone find me please, losing all reserve

I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying



Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't



You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something in you I despise



Cut me

Show me

Enter

I am willing and able

And never any danger to myself

Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain

Or was my tolerance a phase?

Empathy, out of my way



I can't die

I can't die

I can't die

I can't die!



You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something inside me

You all stare, but you'll never see

There's something in you I despise



Despise
