Right About You

Would you still love me if we were down bad and out a home?

I made all my money singin' so sad and lonely songs

But all my diamonds came from dirt

The more I love you, the less I hurt

And now my pen can't find the words



I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars

I wrote songs about drinkin' till you walked in and raised the bar

But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?

Thank God I was right about you



You can say you hate me as long as you don't mean it

Maybe go half crazy, don't need a rhyme or reason

Girl, you can go and pick a fight, slam that door and lock me outside

Just for one night so I can find a brand new melody



I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars

I wrote songs about drinkin' till you walked in and raised the bar

But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?

Thank God I was right about you



I could change up all the chords, get my fingers flowin' free

But as long as you're with me, I can have my harmony



I wrote songs about sinnin', evil women, pills, and cars

I wrote songs about drinkin' till you walked in and raised the bar

But who am I to write rock bottom from the highs you took me to?

Thank God I was right about you



Thank God I was right about you
