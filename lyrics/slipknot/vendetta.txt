Vendetta

I know my uses, I have my pride

But my heart is still untamed

I learn my lessons, I've conquered death

I go on, and I'm unashamed

I'll paint your bones to match my eyes

They're the darkest I have ever seen

Until I'm lucid, I can't be told

I know my voices, they tell me to believe



Another fuckin' accident out of control

All the attitudes will never change

My imitations are leading the way

I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial

I walk away from everything with just a smile

The agony of coming home has gone away

It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's every day



(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?



I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way

A new conspiracy has taken my place

So over and over I smell the decay

Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same

In light of my ability to undermine

I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine

The agony of cynicism beckons me

It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything



(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?



(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?



Ooh, let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end

(Pretend) Pretend that we have nothing left

Let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end

(Pretend) Pretend that we have nothing left

Let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end

(Pretend) Pretend that we have nothing left

Let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end

(Pretend) Pretend that we have nothing left



Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?



(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

Are you ready for the time of your life?



Ooh, let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end

(Pretend) Pretend that we have nothing left

Let's (Pretend) pretend we're not at the end
