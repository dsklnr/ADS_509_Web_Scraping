Fuck you!



Many have come and gone

Still left out of the guttural swansong

Takin' nothin' but the best in the area

Get me grief, but fucker I'll stare you down

Two, three you're out of there

Maybe it's me, but I'm frantic in a panic

Ain't never had a problem since you stopped coming here

Big man walkin' but bitch, I'm still talkin'

Can't you see it's gotta be this way?



Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason not to fuck you up



Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade

Here it comes again - gotta burn again

Time now, throw down, don't dirty me

Right on your ugly ass face because

I ain't not the one who let you in

And I ain't not the one who set you off

But I know damn well when someone's pushin' my buttons

Lemme tell you somethin' - I'll push you back!

"As soon as that camera is off, he gonna fuck that little dog."



Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)

Give me any reason not to fuck you up

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)

Give me any reason not to fuck you up



You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
