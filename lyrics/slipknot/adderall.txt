Adderall

Shallow graves and deepest fears

No one tells me why I'm here

Leather straps on stapled eyes

Gotta scream to cut your ties

Can't subtract from Adderall

Pull you in before you fall

Not as sweet as it appears...

Someone tell me why I'm here



Ooh, you know I'm gone

Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now



All they want is your control

For the Bible scares me so

Smell the ones who came here last

Must've lost the game too fast

We don't read between the lines

Cut too deep to see the signs

Watch me as my blood runs cold-

Now your Bible can take hold



Ooh, you know I'm gone

Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now

Ooh, you know I'm gone

Ooh, you go- I'm onto you now

I'm onto you



Which side do I want to be

This side's got a hold on me

Don't try this home for me now

(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)

Which side do I want to be?

This side's got a hold on me

Don't try this home for me now

(Slide away from thoughts and prayers the easy way)



Ooh, you go... I'm onto you now...

Ooh, you go... I'm onto you now...
