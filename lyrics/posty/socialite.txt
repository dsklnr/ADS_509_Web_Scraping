Fuck

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah



I'm always a drink away from a good day

Put on some Jodeci, gettin' loose, ayy

I pummel the coochie, I'm Bobby Boucher

Maybe that's why they put up with all my bullshit

And I bought a new Bentley without a roof, ayy

In LA they tell me my truck is stupid

Doin' cul-de-sac donuts, man, I'm a nuisance

I left my Prince with the Revolutions



Get hammered all alone

But don't feel bad for me

And my chauffeur drinks PatrÃ³n

So call a cab for me, and I'll leave



Fuck me up, it's only a body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If God exists, it shouldn't be a problem (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah



I'm feelin' naughty up on a Sunday

Fuck in the backseat of a Hyundai

I'm callin' her Shrek 'cause she got a donkey

It's crazy how well we get along

My new best friend I just met

Now it's, "Fuck everybody else"

You love someone for six weekends

And never talk to them again



Call it what you want

It's such a tragedy (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I pulled the shortest straw

Another casualty, guess I'll leave (Ooh-ooh)



Fuck me up, it's only a body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

If God exists, it shouldn't be a problem (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fuck me up, it's my birthday party (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So tell me something we got in common (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
