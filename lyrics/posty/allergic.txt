Allergic

Wasted on Sunday

Erase you on Monday

Allergic, allergic

Gave in by Friday

Went straight back to sideways

Allergic, allergic



I took your pills and your drugs

Just to feel something else

'Cause I can't feel you no more



So sad but true

Friends with all my demons

The only one who sees them

Too bad for you

So sad but true

Give a hundred million reasons

But why could you believe them?

Too bad for you



Yeah we fight and we fuck

Until we open the cuts

And now we're soberin' up

But never sober enough

Allergic, allergic

Instead of holdin' me down

You're only holdin' me up

It shouldn't be so hard

This is impossible love

Allergic, allergic



I took your pills and your drugs

Just to feel something else

'Cause I can't feel you no more



So sad but true

Friends with all my demons

The only one who sees them

Too bad for you

So sad but true

Give a hundred million reasons

But why could you believe them?

Too bad for you



So sad but true

Give a hundred million reasons

But why could you believe them?

Too bad for you
