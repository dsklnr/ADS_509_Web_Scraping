Fallin' In Love

You weren't lookin' for me, I wasn't lookin' for you

That's the thing about love, it's gonna do what it do

And I've never been the scientific type

There's a force goin' on, girl, that I can't deny, yeah



You can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love

And you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love



Try to knock me off my feel-good horse

Can't get in the way of nature runnin' its course

And what goes up, baby, must come down

I'll keep on fallin' when I hit the ground, yeah



You can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love

And you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love



You can stop me from leavin', stop me from runnin'

You can stop this from turnin' into somethin', oh



And you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love

And you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love

Yeah, you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love

And you can't stop me from fallin', stop me from fallin' in love



Huh, ah-ah-ha-ha (Can't stop me, can't stop me, can't stop me)
