Cooped Up / Return Of The Mack

Baby, now I got the flow



I'm about to pull up

Hit switch, pull curtain (Hit switch, pull curtain)

And I been waitin' so long

Now I gotta resurface (Ooh, yeah)

And yeah, we 'bout to toast up

All that bread that we burnin' (I'm on)

'Cause I been feelin' cooped up (Yeah)

I been fuckin' cooped up



Return of the Mack

Can you give me that back?

Return of the Mack

Can you give me that back?



Well, I tried to tell you so (I pull up)

But I guess you didn't know (Let's party)

As the saddest story goes

I've been fuckin' cooped up

Once again, let's party

'Cause I knew it from the start

Baby, when you broke my heart

That I had to come again

And show you that I'd win



You lied to me

All those times I said that I loved you

You lied to me

Yes, I tried, yes I tried

You lied to me

Even though you knew I'd die for you

You lied to me

Yes, I cried, yes I cried

Can you give me that back?



Return of the Mack (There it is)

Return of the Mack (Come on)

Return of the Mack (Oh my God)

You know that I'll be back (Here I am)

I'm about to pull up

Return of the Mack (Once again)

Hit switch, pull curtain

Return of the Mack

And I been waitin' so long

Return of the Mack

Now I gotta resurface

You know that I'll be back

And yeah, we 'bout to toast up

Return of the Mack

All that bread that we burnin'

Return of the Mack

'Cause I been feelin' cooped up

Return of the Mack

I been fuckin' cooped up
