Missin' You Like This

I thought I'd think about you every now and then

When the rain falls down in Kansas, when I hear "Dust in the Wind"

When I told you I was leavin' in that Exxon parking lot

I thought the world would keep on turnin', no one told me it would stop



And I'da called you crazy after we were through

If you'da told me that it'd take me all my life to get over you



I knew for a night, girl, I'd be drinkin' 'bout you

But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you

Cross my heart till I die

I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did

If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this



Wake up in the mornin' in a bed with someone new

She don't know I still got pictures in that box instead of boots

You're the whiskey in my coffee, the unanswered in my prayers

You're the reason I'm still lonely even when the next best thing is layin' right here



I knew for a night, girl, I'd be drinkin' 'bout you

But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you

Cross my heart till I die

I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did

If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this



I'da called you crazy after we were through

If you'da said they'd have to lay me six feet under just to get over you



I knew for a night, that I'd be drinkin' 'bout you

But it's years gone by and I'm still dreamin' 'bout you

Cross my heart till I die

I swear to God, I woulda never done what I did

If I knew that I'd be missin' you like this



I'd be missin' you like this

Missin' you like this
