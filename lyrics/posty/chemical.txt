Chemical

Oxytocin making it all okay

When I come back down it doesn't feel the same

Now I'm sitting around waiting for the world to end all day

'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried



You break me then I break my rules

Last time was the last time too

It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still



Outside of the party, smoking in the car with you

Seven nation army fighting at the bar with you

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

'Cause I can't let go

It's chemical

No, I can't let go

It's chemical



Every time I'm ready to make a change

You turn around and fuck out all my brains

I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face

I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes



You break me then I break my rules

Last time was the last time too

It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still



Standing outside of the party, smoking in the car with you

Seven nation army fighting at the bar with you

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

'Cause I can't let go

It's chemical (Chemical)

No, I can't let go

It's chemical (Chemical)

No, I can't let go

It's chemical



I can't let go

It's chemical



Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

No, I can't let go

It's chemical
