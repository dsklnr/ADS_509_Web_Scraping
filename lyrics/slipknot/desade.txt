De Sade

I feel it now, a new restraint

The fool is only he who fools again (Again), again (Again), again (Again)

I needed all the pain you saved

To wash across my face like time began (Began), began (Began), began (Began)



Everybody lies when they say "forever"

No one else will understand

Pull the stitches tight until we sever

Break me in your open hands



Please, forget me not

I need your simple pleasures to be God

And please, my sweet De Sade

Just take my heart and twist me into knots



I know I never had a chance (Chance), chance (Chance)

Oh, I know I'm wretched and I stand (Stand), stand (Stand)

Seeking all the things you have

If I die with you, it's worth the life, life, life, life (life)



I was just a nothing wanting something

Only you will only do

Everything and more, it comes to nothing

If it doesn't come with you



Please, forget me not

I need your simple pleasures to be God

And please, my sweet De Sade

Just eat my heart and twist me into knots



Something dominating nothing

Nothing animate is something used

Fill me, wait a minute, kill me

Feel me, I am the mood: abuse

Carve, carve, carve

I am starve, starve, starved

For the warmth of your will

And the edge of your purest thrill
