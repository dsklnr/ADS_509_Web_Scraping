Waiting For Never

Should've seen the signs so I guess I deserved it

Made a habit overlooking cracks in the surface

Going along with the bullshit you sold me

What was I to do when the bottle stopped working

Tryna make a home out a house while it's burning down

Burning to the ground



Oh, if all these walls could talk

They would tell me, sit down, man, shut the fuck up

You put me through hell but I can't get enough

It took a little while, baby, then I woke up

Woah, when all these tattoos fade

I would never look back, you'll be in the same place

I keep telling myself if I wanted you to change

I'll be waiting for never, waiting for never



You could've done a better job at hiding your intentions

I know what you did, stop being so defensive

Save it, when did you become so jaded?

I seen so many come and go then come back to me

I never ever let another take half of me

I can't win, but still I chase it



Oh, if all these walls could talk

They would tell me, sit down, man, shut the fuck up

You put me through hell but I can't get enough

It took a little while, baby, then I woke up

Woah, when all these tattoos fade

I would never look back, you'll be in the same place

I keep telling myself if I wanted you to change

I'll be waiting for never, waiting for never



Just look right at my face

Yeah you should stay away

There's nothing left to fake

There's nothing left to take



Oh, if all these walls could talk

They would tell me, sit down, man, shut the fuck up

You put me through hell but I can't get enough

It took a little while, baby, then I woke up

Woah, when all these tattoos fade

I would never look back, you'll be in the same place

I keep telling myself if I wanted you to change

I'll be waiting for never, waiting for never
