This Cold Black

Welcome home



Mother nature is a coward (Mother nature is a whore)

No more presence, no more power (I pray for death, by the hour)

Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are)

My artifice won't recognize me (You won't find me anymore)

Post-traumatic war machines

The pessimists still won't believe

Throw away my past mistakes

It's all I came to feel

Let my weapons be your children

Let my armies be your damned

Try to suffer on in silence

Try to stop me if you can



Pneumatic destroyer

Pathetic seducer

Distortion sufficient

Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)

We'll live our lives again



My ghosts have found their way back home

I have every right to kill my own (Every right to kill my own)

I am something now that never could exist

My anguish conquers all

Pay the price and watch me fall

My only key is broken

My broken key is only me



Pneumatic destroyer

Pathetic seducer

Distortion sufficient

Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)

We'll live our lives again



You utter waste of tired flesh

It doesn't matter if you can't progress

Even now they still create me

Give me your ignorance, irritate me

I am made of the same debris

You want it all, but you didn't want me

Hypocrite with no real use

I'm alive, what's your excuse?



Pneumatic destroyer

Pathetic seducer

Distortion sufficient

Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)

We'll live our lives again



Pneumatic destroyer

Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)

We'll live our lives again



We'll live our lives again
