Windows

She looked so beautiful in her white dress

But, with red spots, is when she looked best



Skin so soft, her body so warm

Loved her too much to let her come to harm

Skin so pale, her blood was so warm

Loved her too much to let her come to harm



I search for the signs

I reach for the words

It's come to far

Now we've begun



One small piece of her

I kept for myself

A lock of her hair

Laid upon a shelf



What I'd promised her, I'll place upon a knife

This is only to give her a better life

Every ounce of strength I've lost into the knife

Love is suicide, give her a better life



I've brought the killer forth

My mind's racked with guilt

Bed sheets tied in knots

I feel what she felt



I still can feel

I still can feel

The pain is real

I'm not dead yet



Visions of my hands

Lots of torturing

As I slowly die

These windows laugh at me



Did it-it-it, done!

Did it-it-it, done!

Did it-it-it, done!

Did it-it-it, done!



I drift away!

I drift away!

I drift away!

I drift away!

I drift away! (I drift away)!

I drift away! (I drift away)!

I drift away! (I drift away)!

I drift away! (I drift away)!
