Too Cool To Die

I put a sunglass on, so I don't have to say hi (Hi)

Send a text after I'm gone, I don't say goodbye (Bye)

And my Miss USA called for a ride (Ride)

She filled my tank, I didn't spend a dime (Dime)



And I don't mind at all

And I don't cry

Ask me how I feel

I'm dynamite, and it goes like



I'm not here for long, my baby

I'm just passin' by

The world keeps gettin' hotter, baby

But I'm too cool to die



She wanna fuck me on a jet, but I'm scared to fly, ah-ah (Fly)

She wanna feed me fancy drinks and keep me up all night, ah-ah-ah (Night)

She asked me if I like this wedding ring

For fuck's sake, it's our first date

I did, and then I went

And bought it on the next date, fits me great, uh



And I don't mind at all

And I don't cry (I don't cry, don't cry)

Ask me how I feel

I'm dynamite, and it goes like



I'm not here for long, my baby

I'm just passin' by (Passin' by)

The world keeps gettin' hotter, baby

But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool, I'm too cool)

I'm not here for long, my baby (I'm not)

I'm just passin' by (I'm just passin' by)

The world keeps gettin' hotter, baby

But I'm too cool to die (I'm too cool to die)



I'm too cool to die

I'm too cool to die
