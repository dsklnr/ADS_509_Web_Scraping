Euthanasia

Took a fuckin' sip from my ash can

It didn't bother me too much

I spit another tooth in the trash can

I gave up on keepin' me in touch



When I

Go out

It ain't gonna hurt at all

A choir of angels

Euthanasia



Behold, a sober moment

Too short, and far between

I should crack one open

To celebrate being clean



When I

Go out

It ain't gonna hurt at all

An end to anger

Euthanasia



When I

Go out

It ain't gonna hurt at all

Familiar stranger

Euthanasia



They say it's painless

Euthanasia
