Joy

Joy is the coldest lover I know

Only because she never comes

I was the coolest dude I know

Guess I was born too close to the sun



The harder I try, the more I become miserable

The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no

Is what we want who we are?

Oh, ooh

Pray for me, I don't want to be, ah, miserable



Joy is the coldest lover I know

Some reason I keep coming back for more

I crashed my car, the paint job was off

La-la, la-la-la

Will I even know when its too much?



The harder I try, the more I become miserable

The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no

Is what we want who we are?

Oh, ooh

Pray for me, I don't want to be, ah, miserable



The harder I try, the more I become miserable

The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no

Is what we want who we are?

Oh, ooh

Pray for me, I don't want to be, ah, miserable
