Acidic

I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes

Stolen coat, not much hope with these cardiac blues

And I keep forgettin' I'm not a god like you

Trivialize a mirror image alive

I won't trouble you, I'm just trouble

Now, now, now, now, now



We don't have to leave it alone

We don't even have to be alone

We just have to think we're alone

So everybody leaves us alone



I don't serve my time

'Cause time don't tell

The grim is behind me

I'm always aligned with my selves

Come and lead me on

Come and see me on

Come and feed me on

The shit we all be on



I'm not a god, like you

I'm not a god, like you

Yeah



I'm runnin' in a dead man's shoes

Sacrilege, broken cartilage

I'm beaten and bruised

And I keep forgettin' to forget



The back is always front

The way is always shut

The one is always two

I'm not a god

The back is always front

The way is always shut

The one is always two

I'm not a god like you



Ooh

Ooh



I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes

I'm livin' in a dead man's shoes

Dead man's shoes
