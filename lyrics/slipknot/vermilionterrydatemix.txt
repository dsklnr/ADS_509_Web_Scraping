Vermilion (Terry Date Mix)

She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities

So fragile yet so devious, she continues to see

Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest

Enter the night that she came home, forever

Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!



She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic

My Dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me

I get nervous, perverse, when I see her, it's worse

But the stress is astounding

It's now or never, she's coming home, forever!

Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!



Hard to say what caught my attention

Vixen crazy, aphid attraction

Carve my name in my face to recognize

Such a pheromone cult to terrorize



I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me



Yeah!



Oh, I'm a slave and I am a master

No restraints and unchecked collectors

I exist through my need to self-oblige

She is something in me that I despise



I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

(I won't let this build up inside of me)

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me

I won't let this build up inside of me



She isn't real

I can't make her real

She isn't real

I can't make her real

She isn't real (She isn't real)

Can't make her real (Can't make her real)

She isn't real (She isn't real)

Can't make her real
