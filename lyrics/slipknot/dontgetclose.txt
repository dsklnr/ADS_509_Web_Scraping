Don't Get Close

Come on!



Somebody give me some light not pointed into dark

Somebody show me the end and I try to push a start

I'm trying to figure out a better way, a better answer

But I keep finding all the problems I've been looking after

You can't wander through the world with nothing but a smile

I'll take your tongue for words and use it to instill denial



Don't get close

You don't know me and you'll never know

Chivalry will get you somewhere

Rivalry will take you there

Don't get close

You don't know me and you'll never know

Chivalry will get you somewhere

Rivalry will take you there



Maybe I should look away before I really miss

Maybe I should pick the time before I pick the place

I bet you all the things that you emulate, you penalize

But I don't wanna go until you learn to finalize



Don't get close

You don't know me and you'll never know

Chivalry will get you somewhere

Rivalry will take you there

Don't get close

You don't know me and you'll never know

Chivalry will get you somewhere

Rivalry!



You ascertain the plot, my vision's overshot

I have the best confection, I was gone for all the lessons

Who coined these words I use? Stay out and be abused

I didn't want to be the undeniable source of everything



Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close (You'd better stay away)

Don't get close (You'd better stay away)

Don't get close (You'd better stay away)

Don't get close (You'd better stay away!)



Waiting, watching all the conflicts

Constrict, just to fit in, squeeze in

I can insist claws and fist

Remember, remember



You take the reverent and never make much sense

I have the worst possession, what I want but so obsessive

Come out and be abused 'cause this is so confused

I only want to be left alone and rot away



Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close

Don't get close (You'd better stay away)

Don't get close (You'd better stay away)

Don't get close (You'd better stay away!)

Yeah!

Yeah!
