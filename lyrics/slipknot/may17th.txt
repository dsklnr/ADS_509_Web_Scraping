Gross!



I am, a little boy

I run and hide, I'm alone

I am, nothing new

I'm sick of you, leave me alone

I am careless

Wrecked constantly

I have no mercy

Mercy and singled out



Digging through myself, there's gotta be a better way

All I really want to do is to make through a fucking day

You just tell me one thing that I can't do

Stop bother asking because I hate you



I am, a little boy

I'm running high

I'm alone

I am hating you, sick of you

Leave me alone



(Ass! Hole!) Why you gotta try me? Just on the way I go to

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna fight me? Gimme a way you little

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna struggle? Gonna find a way you little

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna fight me? Fight me like the way you do



Taking, taking another way, taking another way

Present, present's on the way, present's on the way

Killing, killing on the way, killing on the way

Finding, finding another way, finding another way

Taking, taking another way, taking another way

Present, present's on the way, present's on the way

Killing, killing on the way, killing on the way

Finding, finding another way, finding another way



Digging through myself, there's gotta be a better way

All I really want to do is to make through a fucking day

You just tell me one thing that I can't do

Stop bother asking 'cause I hate you



(Ass! Hole!) Why you gotta try me? Just on the way I go to

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna fight me? Gimme a way you little

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna struggle? Gonna find a way you little

(Ass! Hole!) Why you gonna fight me? Fight me like the way you do



(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am

(Who are you) I am
