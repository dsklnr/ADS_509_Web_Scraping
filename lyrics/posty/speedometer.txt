Speedometer

I just bought a new Lamborghini

That SOB goes 225

You called my phone, said you wanted to see me

I couldn't think of a better reason to drive



Led pedal

For your lovin' I would run all the lights

Won't let go

And I can't wait to push my speedometer



Push my, push my, push my, push

Speedometer

Push my, push my, push my, push

Speedometer



Turn the lights off

And put the record on

That you showed me that makes you so horny

Let's make a baby tonight



Led pedal

For your lovin' I would run all the lights

Damn, uh-oh

Yes, I know how fast I was going, please, officer



Push my, push my, push my, push

Speedometer

Push my, push my, push my, push

Speedometer



My speedometer

Speedometer

My speedometer

Push my, push my, push my, push

Push my, push my, push my, push
