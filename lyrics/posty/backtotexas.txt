Back To Texas

Sang some songs in Nashville

And L.A. was L.A.

Ran up that Prevost gas bill

Made friends with TSA

Hell, I've been everywhere, man

And I've 'bout had enough

The more I live

The more I get

Sick and tired of



All hat, no cattle

All belt, no buckle

All snake, no rattle

All honey, no suckle

And I'ma take every last dime

Stuffed under this mattress

And make a lonestar B-line

And take my ass back to Texas



Ran outta luck in Vegas

And broke down in Mobile

I ain't found nowhere like Dallas, yeah

And I doubt I ever will



It's all hat, no cattle

All belt, no buckle

All snake, no rattle

All honey, no suckle

And I'ma take every last dime

Stuffed under this mattress

And make a lonestar B-line

And take my ass back to Texas



Take 'em home



All hat, no cattle

All belt, no buckle

All snake, no rattle

All buttin', no scuttle

And I'ma take every last dime

Stuffed under this mattress

And make a lonestar B-line

Take my ass back to Texas

I ain't a-wastin' me no time

Take my ass back to Texas
