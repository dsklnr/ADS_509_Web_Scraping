I Know

Our love, will never be another

You're just a devil undercover

Found you when you were in the gutter

Shit was sweet until I was a sucker



Shout out Jonas Brothers

I learned more than I cared to discover

Don't you know that I'm more than a come up

You act up then act like it's nothing

Sold your soul, you Stone Cold, you a Stunner



Every time you left, shit was never right

In another bed every single night

Had it to a science, you were so precise

See it in your eyes, saw you in the light

Somehow mami, I still want you

Listen to me, don't drive away

Kill me softly, your hold on me is

Something I can't explain



I know you could never be my bitch

Shit could never be like this

I know, stop thinking you're in my plans

Hunnid times, you blew another chance

I know, you were getting down on the low

Then running back to me in the morning

I know, shit could never be like this

You could never be my bitch, no, no



Our love, will never be another

You're just a devil undercover

Found you when you were in the gutter

Shit was sweet until I was a sucker



Rather be single for life

Than be fucking with you

I ain't rolling the dice, no

I ain't playing to lose



Every time you left, shit was never right

In another bed every single night

Had it to a science, you were so precise

See it in your eyes, saw you in the light

Somehow mami, I still want you

Listen to me, don't drive away

Kill me softly, your hold on me is

Something I can't explain



I know you could never be my bitch

Shit could never be like this

I know, stop thinking you're in my plans

Hundred times, you blew another chance

I know, you were getting down on the low

Then running back to me in the morning

I know, shit could never be like this

You could never be my bitch, no, no



(Be my bitch)

(It could never be like that)

(It could never be like that)

(It could never be like that)
