Lust Disease

Scrape the excess

That's good for my head

Face the part of me

The waste they still behold

I feel so subtly

My favorite cut

I'll erase it

Is this the one in the sky?



(Do your own the dotted line) Ponder in the face

(I know it will remain) The one I left behind

(Keep moving from the day) Hang it up to dry

(Fear it 'til it's ready to crumble)



(In the closet) It will be the same

(The same as always) As it was before

(For the will) Keep crawling through my head

(And I'm bleeding) With this lust disease



Tainted happiness, hiding my weaknesses

Tape my eyes shut

Set my mind at ease

Force the good out

Feel my soul burn

I will trace it

Is it safe in my own skin?



(Do your own the dotted line) Ponder in the face

(I know it will remain) The one I left behind

(Keep moving from the day) Hang it up to dry

(Fear it 'til it's ready to crumble)



(In the closet) It will be the same

(The same as always) As it was before

(For the will) Keep crawling through my head

(And I'm bleeding) With this lust disease



I feel nothing

Just a picture inside

The weight of what to take

I'm losing the places, the places I use to hide

I feel nothing

Just a picture inside

The weight of what to take

I'm losing the places, the places I use to hide



(In the closet) It will be the same

(The same as always) As it was before

(For the will) Keep crawling through my head

(And I'm bleeding) With this lust disease

(In the closet) It will be the same

(The same as always) As it was before

(For the will) Keep crawling through my head

(And I'm bleeding) With this lust disease
