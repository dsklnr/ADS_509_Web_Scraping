Don't Understand

I'm a rolling stone

It took you by surprise

You're hangin' onto something, anything

Just like a shimmer of light

Oh, how the sword, it fell

I said, "You're really something, everything

To me, and I'm cold

So hold me closer, baby"



I don't understand why you like me so much

'Cause I don't like myself

I don't understand why you like me so much

Wish I was someone else

You say you got a million reasons

But I can't think of one

I don't understand why you like me so much

'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm



I'll build a church for you

They'll come from miles around

Girl, you're really something, everything

To me, and I'm cold

So hold me closer, baby



I don't understand how you like me so much

'Cause I don't like myself

I don't understand how you like me so much

Wish I was someone else

You say you got a million reasons

But I can't think of one

I don't understand how you like me so much

'Cause I don't like myself, mm-mm, mm-mm
