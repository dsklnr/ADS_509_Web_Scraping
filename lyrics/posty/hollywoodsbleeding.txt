Hollywood's Bleeding

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feeding, darkness turns to dust

Everyone's gone but no one's leaving, nobody left but us

Tryna chase a feeling but we never feel it, riding on our last train home

Dying in our sleep, we're living out a dream, we only make it out alone



I just keep on hoping that you call me

You say you wanna see me but you can't right now

You never took the time to get to know me

Was scared of losing something that we never found

We're running out of reasons but we can't let go

Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home



Outside the winter sky turning grey

City up in smoke it's only ash when it rains

Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day

Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away

In the morning, blocking out the sun with the shades

She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay

It seem like dying young is an honor

But who be at my funeral? I wonder

I go out, and all the eyes on me

I show out, do you like what you see?

And now, they closing in on me

Let 'em sharpen all they teeth

This is more than I can handle

Blood in my Lambo

Wish I could go, I'm losing hope

I light a candle, some Palo Santo

For all these demons, wish I could just go on



I just keep on hoping that you call me

You say you wanna see me but you can't right now

You never took the time to get to know me

Was scared of losing something that we never found

We're running out of reasons but we can't let go

Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home
