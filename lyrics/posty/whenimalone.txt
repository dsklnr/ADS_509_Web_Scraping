When I'm Alone

We made a pact

You'd take me back

Always, again



I'm bleedin' out

I need you now

Can't let you win



I want it all, I want it all

I push so hard, I break it

My only home went down in smoke

It's bitter sweet, I taste it



So are you lonely?

'Cause I'm healin' slowly

In a moment, your memory is fadin' on me



Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken

Let's see what I'm made of

Find out if I can take it, now



When I'm alone

Pretend I'm letting you go

Just tell me who to blame

For this



When wakin' up

Feels like a punch in the gut

Just tell me, who's to blame

For this?



All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side

When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side

I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night

When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride

Damn



Then my baby found out

Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel

Ain't that bad, I got room service

Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel



What your life like? Need a lifeline right now

Ninety nine nights, tryna get my mind right now

Life is sour, even when I'm in the limelight now

But I try somehow



When I'm alone

Pretend I'm letting you go

Just tell me who to blame

For this



When wakin' up

Feels like a punch in the gut

Just tell me, who's to blame

For this?
