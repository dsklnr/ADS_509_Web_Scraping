"Yea!"

"Ha-ha"

"Ah..."

"Ahahah"



"Aha..."



Relax, it's over

You belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt

Relax, it's over

You can never leave, I take your second digit with me, love



"Ah..."



You are my first

I can barely breathe, I find you fascinating

You are my favorite

Lay you down to sleep, it's all that I can do to stop, love



"Ah..."



So blue, so broken

Paper doll decays, I haven't left you yet

So cold, subversive

Your eyes are full of bleach, tomorrow I will go away again, love



"Love..."

"Ah"

"Oh, God"

"Oh, God!"



"It tears us. It makes us"

"It makes all one!"

"It tears us apart..."

"It tears us apart!"



"It cuts us, it cuts us all"



"I can't breathe"



You are mine

You will always be mine

I can tear you apart

I can recombine you

All I want is to covet you all

You belong to me

I will kill you to love you (love you)



"You fucking bitch..."



"Fuck you"

"Fucking bitch!"

"Do you see?"

"Do you see"

"Do you see!"



"It's you and I, love"

"Ah"

"You"

(Emtakooltnod)

"You"

"You and I"

"I can smell you"

"Ah..."

"I can smell you all over me!"

"Hahah..."



I fucking- told you

(Fucking told you...)

I fucking told you!

You'll live forever!

"Ha-ha"

(You will live forever)
