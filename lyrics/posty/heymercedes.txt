Hey Mercedes

On the porch with a beer

Saw you park between all these jacked-up trucks

And girl, it's pretty clear

That you don't come around here much



Just had to stop you 'fore you got inside

And the boys started gettin' in line



Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your night?

Pretty lady

Would you wanna take me out for a ride?

I don't know why you came, where you're from, what's your name

And I know that you don't know mine

Call me crazy

Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your life?



Baby, I'm standin' here

Tryna smoke, had to have me a quick cigarette

And now all that I know

Is I'm glad that I ain't quit yet



You never know, girl, it just might be fate

Or a damn good time if it ain't



Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your night?

Pretty lady

Would you wanna take me out for a ride?

I don't know why you came, where you're from, what's your name

And I know that you don't know mine

Call me crazy (Call me crazy, pretty lady)

Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your life?



I've had one too many

To take you down any of these backroads outside of town

I'm just thinking you might

Show me if that thing drives half as good as you look right now



Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your night?

Pretty lady

Would you like to take me out for a ride?

I don't know why you came, where you're from, what's your name

And I know that you don't know mine

Call me crazy (Call me crazy, pretty lady)

Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your life?



Hey Mercedes (Call me crazy, pretty lady)

Hey Mercedes

Whatcha doin' for the rest of your life?
