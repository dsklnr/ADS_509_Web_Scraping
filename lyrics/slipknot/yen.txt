Yen

You're the sin that I've been waiting for

The hands around my throat

It's all I can think about

The smell of sweat and blood

I would feed you all my pleasures

Just to drown in all of yours

Have you heard of me?

Are you hurting me?

Let me savor what I'm waiting for

A chance to make me choke

You're all I can think about

The taste is red and rust

Can I hold you in my mouth

Until I fade into this form?

Can you cover me?

Will you breathe for me?



As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I wanna know that I was dying for you

I died for you

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I wanna know that I was dying for you

I died for you



I don't know what has happened yet

A surge of panicked zeal

Worry when it's not effect

This game is fine by me

All the words for retribution

Only add up to revenge

Overpower me

Devour me



As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I wanna know that I was dying for you

I died for you

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I wanna know that I was dying for you

I died for you



Show me all the deaths are the same

Show me you'll remember my name

Show me all the deaths are the same

You will remember my name



I wish this pain could last forever

Forever

I wish this kill could make me suffer

For good



As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I wanna know that I was dying for you

I died for you

As the knife goes in, cut across my skin

When my death begins

I know that I am dying for you

I'll died for you
