Something Real

Give me somethin' I can feel

Light a cigarette just so I can breathe

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

Seven hundred feet off the coast of Greece

Give me somethin' I can feel (Yeah)

No reservation, pull up twenty deep

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

I would trade it all just to be at peace



Stop, the gear's too high, this is overload

And no matter what car is sittin' outside, it's a lonely road

It's a double-edged sword, cuttin' off ties with the ones I know

So tell me, how the fuck am I still alive? It's a miracle, oh



(No-o-o) And I can't believe, ran through a B at Louis V

It's what I need right now

(No-o-o) It's just money at the gates of hell, no VIP

Everybody waits in line



So give me somethin' I can feel

720S and 750V

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

I was in Maldives sippin' burgundy

Give me something I can feel (Yeah)

Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeve

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

I could play that pussy like it's "FÃ¼r Elise"



I got real habits, I'm a snowmobile addict

Teal Patek steel when I feel panic, ah-ah, ah

Throw a mil' at it, problem, throw a pill at it

Still at it, sign-another-deal addict (Ah-ah, ah)



And I can't believe everybody gets to drink for free

So give me one more round (Oh-oh-oh)

No cover fee at the gates of hell, no VIP

Everybody waits in line



So give me somethin' I can feel

Light a cigarette just so I can breathe

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

How much psilocybin can a human eat?

Give me somethin' I can feel (Yeah)

Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah)

And it's what I want, it ain't what I need

Give me somethin' I can feel (Yeah, ooh)

Got everything, guess I'm hard to please

Give me somethin', somethin' real (Yeah, ooh)

I would trade my life just to be at peace



Give me somethin' I can feel (Ah, ooh)

Give me somethin', somethin' real
