The Dying Song (Time To Sing)

Put your hands into the water

Let your mouth go sick and dry

Put your life into your death now

Let them sing until you die

Die, die, die, yeah



Radical rather than rhetorical, babble like an oracle

Why am I always in your debt?

Father and the son and the holy ghost

Communist comatose, show me all the wagers are a bet

The middle of a nuclear winter is a modern achievement of the retro apocalyptic horde

Satan? You must be mistaken, there are no more satans

Only the bosses on the board

Forget, deny, ignore, nice try, it's you

Regret, rely, remorse inside of you

Yeah



Maybe you've been down too long

Maybe you've been down too long



The heart begins to suffer

When the soul has given up

And the flesh is barely more than bone

When no one else is listening

Only when you've had enough

Time to sing this dying song alone

Put your hands into the water

Let your mouth go sick and dry

Put your life into your death now

Let them sing until you die

Die, die, die, yeah



Maybe you've been down too long

Maybe you've been down too long



Think hard, you bastards

You're gonna tell me why

If I don't get an answer

You're gonna sing and die

Think hard, you bastards

You're gonna tell me why

If I don't get an answer

You're gonna sing and die



The heart begins to suffer

When the soul has given up

And the flesh is barely more than bone

When no one else is listening

Only when you've had enough

Time to sing this dying song alone

Put your hands into the water

Let your mouth go sick and dry

Put your life into your death now

Let them sing until you die

Put your hands into the water

Let your mouth go sick and dry

Put your life into your death now

Let them sing until you die
