I see shit in LA sky

LA nights getting too damn high

Codeine in my blood, mud in my sprite

Nicotine in a bud on LA lights

Fuck all that shit about a human rush

I'm making real cliche black and white

I don't wan't to see your face in my line aside

Oh boy you try to stuntin' on me

It don't happen

Couple benjies stashing at matress

Tell her back it up she ass backwards

Sorta I'm a bring it back to my adject

To tell her she can have a sit with my active

She going smoke weed and then she going ash it

Tell that girl don't be getting distractive

Boy! I pull up with your hoe

The voodoo good so I roll it

Thirteen blunts boy I smoke it

Thirteen life boy I know it

Throw four in it when I feeling whitney

All this drinking is killing my kidneys

All this sip I'm sipping going to kill me

And motherfuckers walk like they ridding with me

Two shine in my mouth

Bad bitches all on my couch

You know us for a win a backout

Hit em with a 
[?]
 wow-wap she blackout

Boy I don't drink so much I pass out

Hoes fall asleep in order ass out

Boy I don't drink so much I pass out

Woke up in a spot on my cashout



I see shit in LA sky 
[x4]

No op
