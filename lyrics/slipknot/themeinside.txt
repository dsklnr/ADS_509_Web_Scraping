The Me Inside

Inside! Inside! Inside! Inside!

Inside! Inside! Inside! Inside!

Inside! Inside! Inside! Inside!

Inside! Inside! Inside! Inside!

Inside! Inside! Inside! Inside!



Numbing machines, assumes as its own

Reaction has feeling

Grinding me away

Killing me within myself

Losing all my hope

I must find a core...



(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!



My words

Death to my soul

Reaction is pain

Grinding me away

I must

Redeem myself

Or I'll destroy

Everything you know!



(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!

(Tearing me) Inside!



I swear I've got a cancer inside

All of me is in my mind

Cut my throat to last time

I bleed too, on the inside...



Doom (Pain)

Doom (Pain)

Doom (Pain)

Doom (Pain)



I swear I've got a cancer inside

All of me is in my mind

Cut my throat to last time

I bleed too, on the inside...
