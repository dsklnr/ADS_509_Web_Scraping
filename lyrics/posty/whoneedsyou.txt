Who Needs You

Give me a night, a bar, and a bottle to sip on

A neon light and a stool to sit on

And I'll be on my way straight to regret

And I don't wanna see the sunshine anymore

I'll be on the dark side right behind them same old swingin' doors, oh



Who needs you when I can break myself in two?

I can make my grey skies blue if that's what I aim to do

And I tear it all to pieces, I don't need no blue eyed reason

Baby, who needs you when I can break myself in two? Oh



I don't need your suitcase and a car in the fast lane

To turn this bottle into where Jack ain't

Me, myself, and I can get the job done fine

So don't flatter yourself anymore

I can make me lonelier than you can if we're keepin' score



Who needs you when I can break myself in two?

I can make my grey skies blue if that's what I aim to do

And I tear it all to pieces, I don't need no blue eyed reason

Baby, who needs you when I can break myself in two? (Eat 'em alive, Larry, come on)



If I can change this cloudy weather

Then I can put me back together



Baby, who needs you when I can break myself in two?

Baby, who needs you when I can break myself in two? Oh
