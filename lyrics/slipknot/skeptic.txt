Pissed!



Only when the fates

Commiserate

Do we get a little taste as unique?

The libertine

Know what I mean?

Hiroshima on a Sunday



You had a gift

You were a gift

But there's always a goddamn catch

Blessing and a curse

You made it work

The universe seems so much smaller



Legend! Bastard! Best friend!

Why?

Why do the limits have to realign?

Hero! Martyr! Mystery!

God, he was the best of us



The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you

The world will never know another man as amazing as you



Never be the same

I want the blame

To be assigned to the guiltiest one

It can't be done

Because the son

Was the victim they arrested



I'm so fucking pissed

At all of this

You gotta know that you are sorely missed

Miracles are real

They help you heal

They make you feel like things will get better



Father! Brother! Scapegoat! Why?

Why did we only get this time?

Fighter! Icon! Skeptic

God, stop taking the best of us



I won't let you disappear

I will keep your soul alive

If I can't have you here

History may have its share

Of lunatics and stars



But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you

The world will never know another man as amazing as you

The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you

The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Where am I supposed to begin?

I'm killing for the karma again

Feed the meter in the machine

Believing is the way to be seen



Gone â are we alone?

Gone â are we alone?

Gone â are we alone?

Gone â we're not alone



I can't let you disappear

I will keep your soul alive

If I can't have you here

We were meant to be the kings

Rule the masses, run the risks

And keep our systems clean

History may have its share

Of lunatics and stars



But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you

The world will never know another man as amazing as you

The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you

The world will never know another man as amazing as you



The world will never see (will never see)

Another crazy motherfucker like you (like you)

Like you (like you)

Like you
