Have The Heart

Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours

Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse

You're so sweet, and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door

Mm-hmm

Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours



I should be calling it quits instead of calling you up

We should be making some plans instead of making love

We're playing chicken with enough is enough



Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours

Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse

You're so sweet, and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door

Mm-hmm

Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours



I don't have the heart

Mmm, mmm, mmm

Wanna hear something sexy?



I like the way that my bed is looking over your boots

And them bell-bottoms I wear make walking out hard to do

We know well that it ain't gonna work

Oh, what the hell's one more night gonna hurt?



Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours

Yeah, and trouble rode in on the back of a pale white horse

You're so sweet, and tryna leave is like slamming a revolving door

Mm-hmm

Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours

To break yours



We should saw this love in half on a sawdust floor

Baby, I don't have the heart to break yours

Baby, I don't have the heart

To break yours

I just can't do it
