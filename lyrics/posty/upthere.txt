Up There

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh



When I took a ride in the dead of night

Told myself that everything was okay

Try to understand how you standin' over me

Girl, it's drivin' me crazy

Yeah, it's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night

The only heat, it come from the ashtray

I might as well get high as hell and just keep actin' like

Everything doesn't phase me



Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby

Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby

Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby



I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Actin' like I got it all figured out

I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Must be better than the hell on the ground



Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh



It's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night

And I'ma drop the top with no Rogaine (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

And now might sound irrelevant but I prefer to stack my chips

When everything fallin' (backwoods)

And I ain't religious but I look into the sky

And pray to anyone holy

I been drinkin' way too much and man I got the blues

Because my baby don't hold me



Yeah, take me all the way to the top, baby

Don't even if I tell you to stop, baby

Take me all the way to the sky, baby, baby



I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Actin' like I got it all figured out

I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Must be better than the hell on the ground

I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Actin' like I got it all figured out

I wanna go up there

And I don't ever wanna come down

I wanna see what's up there

Must be better than the hell on the ground
