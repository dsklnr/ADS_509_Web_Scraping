Finer Things

Catfish caviar, south of Florida cigar

Stag grip single-action fallin' out my Chrome Hearts

Platinum on my teeth and wagyu on my grill

And George Jones crankin' out my Coupe DeVille

Yeah, I'm a five-star

Hell raisin' dive bar rockstar



I got a thing for the finer things

I'm in that deer blind with a diamond ring

My Lambo' and my ammo's all camo green

Yeah, I got a F-1 Trillion limousine

I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat

I got a thing, got a thing for the finer things, yeah, I do, hmm



I got a 50-foot pontoon, tripled up Evinrude

Leavin' me a tidal wave of wake when I flow through

Sippin' on a Solo of Pappy Reserve

Big H on the top for my getaway bird

Aw, turn up the "Ramblin' Man"

Till the whole lake knows I'm a Hank fan



I got a thing for the finer things

I'm in the deer blind with a diamond ring

My Lambo' and my ammo's all camo green

Yeah, I got a F-1 Trillion limousine

I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat

I got a thing, got a thing for the finer things, yeah, I do



I got a thing for the finer things

I'm in that deer blind with a diamond ring

My Lambo' and my ammo's all camo green

Yeah, I got a F-1 Trillion limousine

I got a ten-point blonde in the shotgun seat

I got a thing, got a thing for the finer things, yeah, I do



Yeah, I do, hmm
