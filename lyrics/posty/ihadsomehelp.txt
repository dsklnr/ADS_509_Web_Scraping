I Had Some Help

You got a lot of nerve, don't you, baby?

I only hit the curb 'cause you made me

You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy

Like I'm the only one



Why'd you throw them stones if you

Had a wild hair of your own or two?

Livin' in your big glass house with a view

I thought you knew



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kind of mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

They say teamwork makes the dream work

Hell, I had some help (Help)

(Help)



You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumblin'

Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'

Already lost the game that you been runnin'

Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh

You think that you're so innocent

After all the shit you did

I ain't an angel you ain't heaven-sent

Can't wash our hands off this



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kind of mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

They say teamwork makes the dream work

Hell, I had some help (Help)

(Help)

(Help)

(Help)



It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh

Baby, you blame me and baby, I blame you

Oh, if that ain't the truth (Oh)



I had some help

It ain't like I can make this kind of mess all by myself

Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell

They say teamwork makes the dream work

Hell, I had some help (Help)

(Help)
