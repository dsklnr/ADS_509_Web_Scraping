Some Feel

Some feel I don't exist

Never believing what they see

Some feel that I'm not fair

I leave no time for repentance

Tearing the veil, mending the veil

Tearing the veil

Tearing the veil, mending the veil

Tearing the veil



Some feel I bear the mark of man

A misguided philosophy

Some feel I kill for fun

I kill for life

I can't escape what Gaia's left for me 

I can't deny the lack of morality

I can't believe (no) what Gaia's left for me (more)

I can't escape (no) the lack of morality (less)



Need time to think, need time to think

Need to spill blood so I can drink

Take what they give, take what they give

Some feel I'm dead, yet I still live!

Need time to think, need time to think

Need to spill blood so I can drink

Take what they give, take what they give

Some feel I'm dead, yet still I live!

Low!



They don't know I'm eternal

They don't know they're just cattle

They don't know I'm eternal

Eternal!
