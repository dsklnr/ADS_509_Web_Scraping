Insane

(Yeah, we want to go insane)



Take your bitch

Give her back, insane

Sent her packing

She was actin' crazy

Goin' batshit

In the backseat, range

She was classy

Now she nasty, hey



I'm a bachelor

I'm a bastard, hey (Wow)

Don't believe me?

You can ask her, hey

Goin' batshit

In the backseat, range

She was classy

Now she nasty, hey



Bring that ass

Meet me back stage

A million racks

I need it cash, cake



Yeah, we both got a car but it's different

Yeah, we both got a house but it's different

Yeah, we both got teeth but it's different

(Both got teeth, both got teeth, yeah)



I wanna see somethin' in a short skirt, please

I wanna see somethin' in a shirt skort, please (Wow)



Treat my top like my ex, I'ma

Cut it off completely

Treat my top like my ex, I'ma

Cut it off completely



Take your bitch

Sent her packing

She was acting crazy

Goin' batshit

In the backseat, range (Wow)

Second verse

Second verse, yay

Second verse

Second verse, again



Put her on game

This is not the same, though

This is a Mulsanne

Diamonds make a rainbow

Keep my Glocky tucked like a baby in a manger

When your girl around me, she treat you like a stranger

I got 20, 30 strippers in the Sprinter van

It's a little cramped to try to teach me how to dance



Oh, and you talkin' that shit but

You ain't gonna do shit, ooh (Gonna do shit, ooh)

I ain't even gotta get up (Get it)

Ain't nobody scared of you, ooh (Damn)
