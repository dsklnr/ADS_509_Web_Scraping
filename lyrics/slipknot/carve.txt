Salt my wounds, then lick them clean

Cloud of dust, and then I'm gone

Filled within by vindictiveness

A release, I need a release

Searching for an explanation

Way to make you understand

May I feel, my fascination

My need to cut. My need to cut, to carve



Bleeding upon the silken pigtails

Watching the stain spiral down

Force the issue with the klaive

Releasing all the pain I've saved



(Carve) There's something inside

(Carve) There's nothing inside

(Carve) There's something inside

(Carve) Gonna let it out now

(Carve) There's something inside

(Carve) Nothing inside

(Carve) Something inside

(Carve)



Pants so soft, so I get off with that

Sticky, wet bass rap, gonna get your ol' face slapped

Bring more slicing, dicing, and enticing

Gonna slam dunk, you fat ass punk

Stickin' your rat face around the boys hidin' place

(Count to four) Won't bring you any more

Lickin' what I'm stickin' in your face like you're in a race

(Don't slow down) 'Cause I'm comin' up

On your ass, like I wanted to pass

Fist-fuck, (Cock-suck) corn-shuck, (Tough luck)

Sortin' through only part that's left of you

(Your big fat, fuckin' mouth)

Eyes and ears all over the countryside

So there's nowhere for you to run and hide

(Form our attack back at our haven)

No one who thinks your life is worth savin'



(Sit down) Gonna beat you down

(Shut up) Gonna rip you up

(Get out) Show you what pain's about

(Fuck you) Won't give you a reach-around

(Sit down) Gonna beat you down

(Shut up) Gonna rip you up

(Get out) Show you what pain's about

(Fuck you) 'Round



Round
