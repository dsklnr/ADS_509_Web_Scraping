California Sober

California sober on the highway 1

Over on the shoulder, thought I saw some fun

Lookin' for a ride

Trouble in some daisies, holdin' out her thumb

Stole some sucker's money, now she's on the run

And she wanna get high



She said, "I'll take you on a little trip

C'mon, give these lips a try"



She drank up all my whiskey, blew down all my smoke

I became the punchline of some cosmic joke

Damn bottle was dry

Kinda wanted to cry

She whispered "Pull it over," I said, "You're the boss"

In a southern drawl said "Here's where I get off"

I've enjoyed our time



She said, "Baby, give me one more kiss

Before I kiss your ass goodbye"



Needed me some diesel just to get back home

Tried to pay the man and found my money gone

Had to bum a ride



So if you see them daisie's walkin' 'round

Son, you best just pass 'em by

And if you see a wallet on the ground

Bet yo' ass, that shit is mine
