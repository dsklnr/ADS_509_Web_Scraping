Do Nothing / Bitchslap

The system has failed, and you have failed with it

No time to care. Just time to say, "Who gives a shit?"

My mind boils as I've decided I'm through

Fuck your position in life, I'm taking vengeance on you

I break down the walls of the political arena

Cast the vote on FN-FAL, yeah, we'll be seeing ya



Come on, y'all

Yeah!

I want

To put a cap right in your asshole

You step to this

You're gonna pass for

A lump of dog shit in the grass, now

Be on your way and get some class

Man, you're like a school in the summer

No class!



Aah

Chop down the big-wigs

Shoot the televisions, too!

My mind boils in life

As I've decided I'm through

The guilty of crimes

Will be hung from the trees

Spit and punches arise

From you and the me



Sit back and do nothing

If that's what you want to do

I will have my reign as king

When I take vengeance on you
