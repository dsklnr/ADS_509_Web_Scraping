Take What You Want

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go



I never needed anything from you

And all I ever asked was for the truth

You showed your tongue and it was forked in two

Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you

Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake

Waited on me to break

Held me under hoping I would drown

Like a plague, I was wasting away, tryna find my way out

Find my way out



And it finally came the day

I start giving my heart away

For heaven's sakes, my bones will break

But you'll never own my soul, no



I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go



I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)

I brought up ten hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)

They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do

I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)

I been sipping forever and just taking whatever

Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around

Let's go our ways, whichever

You say how is however long

'Cause you know I'll never be alone



Love

Shorty gone back

Need it on sight

Crack it all back

Give her that pipe

All of my gang

Shorty went bad



I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go

Why don't you take what you want from me?

Take what you need from me

Take what you want and go



(Take it all away)



Why don't you

(Take what you want, take what you need)

Take what you need from me

(Take what you want, take what you need)

Why don't you

Whatever you need
