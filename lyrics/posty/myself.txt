Myself

(Wish I could've been there myself)



It's what it is, it's how I live

All the places I've been

I wish I could've been there myself

I made so much, spent so much

And I can't get enough

I wish I could've been there myself

(Wish I could've been there myself)



Your second cousin lives in Orlando (Orlando)

And yeah I just finished a show

People shoving shots down their damn throats

Some selling "Yes", but I'm gonna say no (Gonna say no)



It's what it is, it's how I live

All the places I've been

I wish I could've been there myself

(Wish I could've been there myself)

I made so much, spent so much

And I can't get enough (Can't get enough)

I wish I could've been there myself



All of this American dreaming

Everybody sick of believing

Oh, let's not give a fuck, chill

Giving a fuck has no meaning

Oh, I'm sick of believing

All of this American dreaming

Oh, let's not give a fuck, chill

Giving a fuck has no meaning (Oh)



It's what it is, it's how I live

All the places I've been

I wish I could've been there myself

(Wish I could've been there myself)

I made so much, spent so much

And I can't get enough (Can't get enough)

I wish I could've been there myself

(Wish I could've been there myself)

(No I can't get enough)
