Ain't How It Ends

Ain't it a shame, girl?

That we had it all almost

Now there's no other way, girl

That's just the way love goes



'Cause Waylon, Willie

Jones and Whitley

They made all the rules

So I'll just have me one more whiskey

Right here on this stool



Baby, I could put the bottle down

You could say you wanna come back home

I could leave this bar right now

You could meet me at the door with nothin' on

We can find a way to work this out

Aw, but girl, it would feel so wrong

No comin' back 'cause, baby

That ain't how it ends in a country song



Ain't how it ends

In a country song

Ain't how it ends



You gotta have some taillights

The kind that don't turn around

Aw, baby, it ain't right

If we change our minds right now



'Cause Hank and Johnny

Strait and Ronnie

Dunn made all the rules

The girl gets gone, guy ties one on

Like he's 'spose to do, ooh



Baby, I could put the bottle down

You could say you wanna come back home

I could leave this bar right now

You could meet me at the door with nothin' on

We can find a way to work this out

Aw, but girl, it would feel so wrong

No comin' back 'cause, baby

That ain't how it ends in a country song



Ain't how it ends

In a country song

Ain't how it ends



Baby, I could put the bottle down

You could say you wanna come back home

I could leave this bar right now

You could meet me at the door with nothin' on

We can find a way to work this out

Aw, baby, it would feel so wrong

No comin' back 'cause, baby

That ain't how it ends in a country song



Ain't how it ends

In a country song

Ain't how it ends



Ain't how it ends in a country song (Ain't how it ends)

Ain't how it ends in a country song (Ain't how it ends)

In a country song
