What Don't Belong To Me

I can wrap a rope around the moon, tie it up and drag it down to you

Honey, if you ask me to, you know I'd try it

I can put some diamonds 'round your neck, dancin' in a ruby-red sunset

Girl, if you don't wanna land this jet, let's keep on flyin'



Every string, every chord, my guitar

I'll give you everything in the world but my heart



'Cause I gave half to them half-way lovers

I left some to them two drunk summers

Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car

I know I'm never gettin' it back

I lost a lot to that whiskey sippin'

I gave the rest to that rock-star livin'

Take all of me but there's one thing missin'

Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me



What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me

What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me



I can lay you down, I can change your life

Maybe not forever, naw but, baby, for the night

If I knew I'd meet you one day

I woulda never gave it all away



And I wish I could give you the best

'Cause you deserve much more than this hole in my chest



'Cause I gave half to them half-way lovers

I left some to them two drunk summers

Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car

I know I'm never gettin' it back

I lost a lot to that whiskey sippin'

I gave the rest to that rock-star livin'

Take all of me but there's one thing missin'

Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me



What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me

What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me



Yeah, you keep holdin' on, but it's gone when it's gone and you can't replace it

Baby, let's just face it

Baby, let's just face it



'Cause I gave half to those half-way lovers

I left some to them two drunk summers

Left a piece at the bar with the keys to my car

I know I'm never gettin' it back

I gave a lot to that whiskey sippin'

I gave the rest to that rock-star livin'

Take all of me but there's one thing missin'

Baby, I can't give you what don't belong to me



What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me

What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me

What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me

What don't belong to me, what don't belong to me

What don't belong to me
