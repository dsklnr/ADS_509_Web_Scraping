Pour Me A Drink

Fourty hours got me going out my mind

Dallas dropped another game in overtime

Caught a ticket speeding down the '65

You know where I'm going



Guess I really went and messed it up again

Now, my baby's goner than a Tulsa wind

Judging by the stone sober state I'm in

Need to crack one wide open



Somebody pour me a drink

Somebody bum me a smoke

I'm 'bout to get on a buzz

I'm 'bout to get on a roll

Yeah, I've been breakin' my back

Just keepin' up with the Joneses

Y'all know what I mean, and y'all know how it goes

When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way

I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)



Somebody pour me a drink

Pour me a drink



Bourbon brown eyes tryna get me drunk

Ain't stopping til the bottle and the job is done

Hey, I think I might've found my future love

Buddy, you should probably buy her one



Somebody pour me a drink

Somebody bum me a smoke

I'm 'bout to get on a buzz

I'm 'bout to get on a roll

Yeah, I've been breakin' my back

Just keepin' up with the Joneses

Y'all know what I mean?

Yeah, y'all know how it goes

When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way

I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)



Somebody pour me a drink

Somebody pour me a drink



Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh



Somebody pour me a drink

Somebody bum me a smoke

I'm 'bout to get on a buzz

I'm 'bout to get on a roll

Yeah, I've been breakin' my back

Just keepin' up with the Joneses

Y'all know what I mean?

Yeah, y'all know how it goes

When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way

I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)



Somebody pour me a drink

Somebody pour me a drink

Yeah, somebody pour me a drink (Hey)



Yessir, pour me a drink
