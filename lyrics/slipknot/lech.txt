Lech

I know why Judas wept, motherfucker



The fires burn on the summit

Shining a light on the ones I've killed

Survivor's guilt - undetermined

I could murder the world in all the blood I've spilled



Banishment

Sequestered and conquered

To hell with your intelligence

Just figure out your common sense



No one is bulletproof, yeah



I'll eat the skins of my brothers

The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall

Can I fill in the cracks of these feelings

With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all?



Selfishness

Take credit for everything

What more could you ask for?

And does it matter anymore?



No one is bulletproof, yeah



Can you feel the cold?

Fortune never favors the old

Tired of defending myself

Go complain to somebody else

Somebody else



The monsters in your madness

Are the voices in your head

They're scratching at your windows

As you hide beneath the bed

You live like fucking heathens

So you'll die like pagan gods

In between the poisons and the pure

Contagions and the cure



Nine for sure 

Nine for sure 

Nine for sure 

Nine for sure 



I got a bone that's dead inside of me

It's a rotting sick that I don't need

Feel free to vent your denigration

I can't believe I'm saying this

I'll live with my regrets

I'll die by my decisions

I'm not your fucking superstar

Keep it close, you're going way too far



No one is bulletproof

Bulletproof

No one is bulletproof

Bulletproof

No one is bulletproof

Bulletproof
