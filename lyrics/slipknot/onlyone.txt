Only One

Pain

Made to order

Pain

Made to order

Pain

Made to order

Pain



Slappin', sittin', scattin' on my back, trying to relax

Thinking about the facts of the crack runnin' through the pack

Division in thought about the war to be fought

For tryin' to mend the ranks, still I get no thanks

They say they mean no disrespect, but this is in effect

I take to heart the part I play everyday

Uninformed is one thing, stupid is another

Keep runnin' your mouth, but don't call me brother



I'm trying to find someone on my side

'Cause banging heads all the time starts to grind

At my gear and at my will

But persistent I am still

So when one insubordinate fucker tries to test me

Blow to the head, then an entrail rend

Guts on the floor, but you want more

Show you the strength of tenth rank

Pain is the only way to teach kids these days



Open your eyes

You've realized

Talk back to me

Your punk-ass dies



Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away



I'm all you know

Where will you go?

Valhalla's gone

Along with your soul



Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away

Only one of us walks away



Only one of us walks away (Walk the fuck away) (Watch it)

Only one of us walks away (Walk the fuck away) (Watch it)

Only one of us walks away (Walk the fuck away) (Watch it)

Only one of us walks away (Walk the fuck away) (Watch it)
