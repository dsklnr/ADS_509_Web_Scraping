Killed A Man

I killed a man last night, gave him what he deserved

Dug a midnight grave, and I put him in that dirt

I woke up this morning, my conscience fully clear

Felt closer to Jesus than I ever had in years



He can't hurt the ones I love, he can't break no angel's heart

He can't take that whiskey bottle and tear my world apart

He can't stand there in the mirror, he can't tell me no more lies

Yeah, I killed a man, I killed a man last night



Lord knows he had it comin', his sins were adding up

But when he drove that girl away, I finally had enough

I coulda pled the fifth, but I poured it down the drain

Said that sinner's prayer, and I sent him on his way



Now he can't hurt the ones I love, he can't break no angel's heart

He can't take that whiskey bottle and tear my world apart

He can't stand there in the mirror, he can't tell me no more lies

Yeah, I killed a man, I killed a man last night



Wish it didn't take this long

But now he's finally gone



Now he can't hurt the ones I love, he can't break no angel's heart

He can't take that whiskey bottle and tear my world apart

He can't stand there in the mirror, he can't tell me no more lies

He's gone for good this time, I killed a man, I killed a man last night



I killed a man, I killed a man last night

Oh

I killed a man, I killed a man last night, mmm
