Bone Church

Burned my hands, wrapped around the sun

Raise my walls, but the damage is done

I see bugs from the corner of my eyes

Just a shadow, a figment, another empty lie



We kill what we love

We love what we kill

Nothing ever changes

Oh, nothing ever will



And my heart is a memory of the pain

I don't need a miracle

Prayers will not save me again



Again

Prayers will not save me again

Prayers will not save me again

Prayers will not save me again



We kill what we love

Oh, we love what we kill



Do no harm, reminders of the flesh

Blinded storms, the ignorance of rush

One man's jewel is another's moistened knife

Another coward, another cripple, another savior in the light



Don't take the place of my sins

Prayers will not save me again

Prayers will not save me again
