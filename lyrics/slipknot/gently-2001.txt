Gently

Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure

A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life

My past life



Life as I know it now

And whatever may come

It slowly disappears to somewhere in the back of my mind

It will remain there 'til I wish to retrieve it



Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Oh

Yeah

Yeah



Yes, I will stay here for awhile

For I need a break

A break from the pressures of life

And everything that lays in the palms of life's hands



Ooh, life's hands

Yeah

Ooh



This mode is incredible

It's out of this world

Too bad I must always leave it

But that's life, yeah



That's life, yeah

That's life, yeah

That's life, yeah

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Oh, yes
