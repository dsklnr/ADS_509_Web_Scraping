Waiting For A Miracle

Oh my God

Just take the firearm from me

Holy fuck

I understand that I'm too weak



Oh my God

Just shut me up for heaven's sake

So I load one round

I'm scared to die while I'm awake



So I close my eyes

And wait for a miracle



And everything done for the dead after they're dead is for the living

And everything done while they're dead, goddammit, that's our decision

I kept my eyes closed, it was easy, now I see it with perfect vision

And everything done for the dead after they're dead is for the living



Fuck me up

Fuck it, get fucked up, hey

Fuck me up, hey

And stay fucked up
