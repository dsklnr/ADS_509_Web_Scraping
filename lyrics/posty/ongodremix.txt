On God (Remix)

[Hook - Post Malone:]

I might just steal your bitch, that's on God

I might pull up in that 6, that's on God

All my homies off the shits, that's on God

All these bitches off the shits, that's on God

Ay, ay, that's on God (that's on God)

Ay, that's on God

That's on God, that's on God (that's on God)




[Verse 1 - Post Malone:]

I'm a Score 40 something points

It doesn't matter if I'm coming of the bench

On God, On God


[?]
 when I'm a ballin' for the motherfucking Knicks

Oh God, Oh God

We in this bitch and you know my homies flexing like a motherfucking bitch

Oh God, Oh God

I'm trying to get rich and fuck shit ain't really making anybody sit

On Squad, On squad

I told him please I ain't got no time for no stuck up bitch

Sippin' on a 40 when I roll my swish

New Jordans like I'm J.R Smith

Cross Jordan hit a jumper on my A.I shit

I ain't fucking with a bitch she can pay my rent

Ray Allen like I'm Jesus that's all net

And my dad Denzel like I'm heaven sent




[Hook - Post Malone:]

I might just steal your bitch, that's on God

I might pull up in that 6, that's on God

All my homies off the shits, that's on God

All these bitches off the shits, that's on God

Ay, ay, that's on God (that's on God)

Ay, that's on God

That's on God, that's on God (that's on God)
