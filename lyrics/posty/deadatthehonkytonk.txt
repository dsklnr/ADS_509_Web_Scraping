Dead At The Honky Tonk

Knee-deep in the Bulleit, one foot in the dirt

Yeah, his bloodshot eyes are empty as a Monday mornin' church

On a stool in the corner, where he's been all week

Only way I know he's breathin' is he just took a drink



And he keeps headin' toward the neon light



There's a hole in his heart down at the hole in the wall

They found him with his hand wrapped 'round a whiskey poured too strong

There ain't no murder weapon, just a note that says she's gone

And if they put it in the paper, then it wouldn't say much at all

One man dead at the honky tonk



We all saw it comin' from a mile away

And we knew that her goodbye would put him in the grave

And no, she won't go to prison, but he's doin' life

She tied him to the bar and let that firewater rise



Her leavin' sent him to the other side



There's a hole in his heart down at the hole in the wall

They found him with his hand wrapped 'round a whiskey poured too strong

There ain't no murder weapon, just a note that says she's gone

And if they put it in the paper, then it wouldn't say much at all

One man dead at the honky tonk



He's leanin' on that bottle, and it's cuttin' like a knife

And he keeps headin' toward the neon light



There's a hole in his heart down at the hole in the wall

And they found him in there drownin' in a whiskey waterfall

There ain't no murder weapon, just a note that says she's gone

And if they put it in the paper, then it wouldn't say much at all

One man dead at the honky tonk



One man dead at the honky tonk

One man dead at the honky tonk

One man dead at the honky tonk
