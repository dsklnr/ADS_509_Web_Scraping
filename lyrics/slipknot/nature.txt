Nature

He can feel them turn

Spools of milky thread

Folding into thought

Seconds tick apart



You molded it, you made it, you caused it, reaction

You licked it, you stole from it, you lied to it, now watch it die

You beat it, you ate from it, you spit on it, retraction

You ignored it, didn't explain to it, you starved it, now watch it die



(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take any



Resolved to find a way

To curb his skin addiction

To calcify his mind

To find the ones who made him made him this way



Greasy winged, uh cus-diaper beaking caw fuss

I hear your dung falling, I hear your dung falling down

Affing, I mean laughing

I mean affing at me, eyeing my dowNature

Fat jaws, winter winter present present sniff

Sniff for the fifth time, is no time

Do I come, do I go, do they really seem to know

Gotsta get me some of that creamy filling



(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take any



My assembly line of faces are waiting in a row

Stiff, cold, blue complexions that I used to know

Burn abide my yearbook, for there I found no friends

But the ones I knew were shrink-wrapped in the end



(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take anymore

(Reversal)

Can't take any



Can't take any

Can't take any

Can't take any

Their feathers are my hair

Can't take anymore

Can't take anymore

Can't take anymore

Can't take any
