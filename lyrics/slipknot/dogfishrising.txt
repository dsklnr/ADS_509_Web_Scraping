Dogfish Rising

There's a dog loose in the wood



Dogfish risin'

It's good fo' gnawin'

Right-wing in lieu

In the 1990s

Mm

That's got a nice groove to it there

I give 
[?]

I saw a human hand

Windmills like two

Somethin' at my left

(Screaming sphincter muscles)

Post-sniff scrunchies

What the?



Dogfish risin'

Burn them for their nipples

'Nother rubber Rolex

So skinny odd knows

Who wrote these -in' lyrics?



Battery-powered power tool

Black and decker dildos

Fully-covered pocket

(Pop it with bullets) Pop it with balls

God spokes to me

Hootie



Dogfish risin'

Blistered cabbage

Poor fish toenail

Poor thing crawls

Why take free lotion?

Hmm



Lactate freely

Back bunk mushrooms

Foot, clip, lick mud

Redneck percussion

Back off fuck-head!



Dogfish risin'

Pinted carpet art

Pinpoint penis blood

Quarter-inch off fat

What are you laughin' at?




[?]
 squeegee

Crisp cookie crisp food finger

Bug raw in stick wit

Quit corn beef scotus

Fuck it! That dogfish is dead



I'm gettin' the hell out of here, guys

See ya later

Have a good life

Don't even bother payin' me

Fuck this

It pours the lotion on the skin

It pours the lotion on the skin

New dick slick rod

The goddamn lotions

Smithers?

 get you guys could afford to record this in a real studio)

Yes, Mr. Burns? (Sick 
[?]
 fuckin')

Bring me this band

Extra supreme hold on my yearn saddle kids college special

Those biscuits are in abundance tonight

Alright! 
[?]

(Sniff my fannies, please!)

(And my creamer!)

(Sniff my creamer, you motherfucker!)

(Sniff my fannies, please!)

 skinner)

Crusty, fuzzy nuts

Bye!
