Slipknot

Law don't go 'round here, savvy



Pentex sucks, Pentex sucks

They drain the life force of my tribe

Pentex sucks

Bone Gnawers suck, Bone Gnawers suck

They roll around in garbage bins

All Bone Gnawers suck

(Pentex is bleeding

But night is dawning)



The Black Hand sucks, the Black Hand sucks

Those wyrm-tainted bastard leeches

Black Hand sucks

If I had my way, if I had my way

I'd rend them all ripped and torn

All that sucks dies

(Sweet smell bleeding

Glow is melting me)



I bring my klave into battle

Shifting into Crinos

I slay Wyrmfoe

Then I step sideways

You (oh)

You (you) (oh)



You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra

You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra

You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra

You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
