Overdrive

I spend my nights on overdrive

I live my life so over-tired

And there's nowhere I can hide

Now I live my life on overdrive



I could be more like him if that's cool to you

I'd do anything to be cool to you

Cool to you



I spend my nights on overdrive

I live my life so uninspired

There ain't no angels in this world

So I live my life on overdrive



I'd remove my tattoos if that's cool to you

I'd do anything to be cool to you

Cool to you

Uh



I could end it with her if that's cool to you

I'd do anything to be cool to you
