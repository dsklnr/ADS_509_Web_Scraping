Confessions

I know you don't want to see

I know you're not part of me

But you wonder just the same

So I'll let you in on this game



What's on the top is just the beginning

Of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning

It never ends, and with the gifts Luna sends to the apocalypse

On, we defend for the right to live in a perfect world

For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled

Trying to make amends for the Impergium

As Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm



You don't wanna know

All the power of the Wyld that runs through me

Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me

You don't wanna see

Our viewpoint on what hominids are doing

That black inside when frenzy is brewing

You don't wanna feel

The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing

Just where my hopes and dreams are going

I won't let you be

Caught up in a war that you are not part of

I sign this letter, "Your father, with love"



I'm tryna set my mind free

I'm sorry you never knew me

My soul is in recession

Painful to make this confession!



You don't wanna know

All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me

Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me

You don't wanna see

Our viewpoint on what hominids are doing

That black inside when frenzy is brewing

You don't wanna feel

The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing

Just where my hopes and dreams are going

I won't let you be

Caught up in a war that you are not part of

I sign this letter, "Your father, with love"



Love!
