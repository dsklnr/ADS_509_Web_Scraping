All the pins are out

Nothing is leaking anymore

No less than a thousand times

My brain's been scattered about

Forced to deal with suffering

Make it more than a hobby

Leave my past behind me

Life, life



Show me (Show me) (Show me)

Show me (Show me) (Show me)

Show me (Show me) (Show me)

Show me



Now all the pins are back in

The fluids' resumed just one more time

To keep my face in

Life



You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face



Smile while the blade slides down your face

Pain for at least two or three days

You will come to love all your scars

Feel all the blessÃ¨d release

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Pain for at least two or three days

You will come to love your scars

Feel all the blessÃ¨d release

Smile while the blade slides down your face (Smile)

Pain for at least two or three days (Pain)

You will come to love your scars (You)

Feel all the blessÃ¨d release (Feel)



You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)

You hide it all behind your pain face



Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down your face

Smile while the blade slides down face
