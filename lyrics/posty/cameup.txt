Came Up

[Hook - Post Malone:]

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow




[Verse 1 - Key:]

I don't even worry about tomorrow

It might be some money it might be a hoe

I don't where I'm a be tomorrow

Might be counting dough, in bed with your hoe

Ok her nose keep running and the money keep coming

I'm a keep balling hey, Rucker Park Spalding hey

Care free I've be leaving care free

So much kush in the air we can barely even breathe

I really worry about things I don't know

You say I'm living wrong you ain't wrong, money long

So think about it it ain't nothing I don't know

All the money that I saw I don't think I'm ever wrong




[Hook - Post Malone:]

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow




[Verse 2 - Post Malone:]

Don't bother, bitch don't bother

I just left the mall balling hard like Jordan

Out in Fairfax I was smoking Marlboro

Bitch we so high, bitch I'm high as Ayatollah

Bitch I'm three high, bitch I'm high as Ayatollah

She don't want that white coca I ain't talking soda

Bitch ask me do you love me I'm like what I told ya

As I woke up I was smoking on that strong again

That forty keep it funky, I keep it funky

Man I'm smoking on that potent, that's unimportant

I just wanted her to fuck me, need her to fuck me

And she just want all of my money all my fucking money




[Hook - Post Malone:]

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know where I go tomorrow

Bitch I came up and I don't know

I don't know what's gonna come tomorrow
