Two Hearts

Used to be two cars sittin' in the drive

You had your dog, and I had mine

Two sets of keys on a hook by the front door

But this house don't look like home no more



White picket fence, fresh coat of paint

Blacktop drive done turned to grey

You lose it all when there's nothin' to lose

Yeah, that's what happens when two hearts break in two



Sweet little girls, only two and three

They can't even spell "custody"

Oh, a year gone by, and we still don't talk

One big open wound, still pourin' on salt



For-sale sign in our front yard

We only get half of what used to be ours

You lose it all when there's nothin' to lose

Baby, that's what happens when two hearts break in two



There's a leak in my mama's house

That's right above where I'm sleepin' now

Dad's old shotgun still on the wall

Tryin' not to give it a second thought



Hot sun beatin' through them dusty blinds

Only everything's what used to be mine

You lose it all when there's nothin' to lose

Baby, that's what happens when two hearts break in two



Baby, that's what happens when two hearts break in two

Ooh, ooh
