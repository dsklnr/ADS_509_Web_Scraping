Go To Hell

There's just somethin' about that woman

I can't put my finger on

She makes it feel so right

Oh, when she does me wrong



She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it

She can lie to your face and make you buy it

Tell ya she's in love just to spite it

Serve ya humble pie and make ya try it

Smooth-talkin' devil, can't deny it

She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it



Yeah, buddy



Somehow she keeps you comin' back

Always wantin' more

You'll show her a diamond ring

And she'll show you the door



She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it

She can lie to your face and make you buy it

Tell ya she's in love just to spite it

Serve ya humble pie and make ya try it

Smooth-talkin' devil, can't deny it

She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it



Hell yeah



Her personality trait is gettin' even

Make you question everything that you believe in

Give you all the shit you think you're needin'

And take it right back when she's leavin'

She's a full Mason jar of white lightnin'

She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it



Tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it

She can lie to your face and make you buy it

Tell ya she's in love just to spite it

Serve ya humble pie and make ya try it

She's a smooth-talkin' devil, can't deny it

She can tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it



Oh, tell you, "Go to hell" and make you like it

Oh, baby, I love it

Woo!
