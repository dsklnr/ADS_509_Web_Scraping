Goes Without Saying

Coulda turned my whiskey and my Whitley and my crazy down a notch

Coulda bought a few more dozen from that on-my-way-home flower shop

Shoulda said I'm sorry, finally got around to changin'

Yeah, it goes without sayin', oh



And it goes without sayin', she ain't comin' back

It goes without sayin', she put me in the past

That train left the station, she didn't have to tell me why

There she goes without sayin', without sayin' goodbye

Sayin' goodbye



I coulda put her first, tucked in my shirt and gone to church 'stead of stayin' out

Coulda told her not to go, and stopped her old red Honda leavin' town

I could list a hundred reasons why she did the walkin'

But her taillights are doin' all the talkin', oh



And it goes without sayin', she ain't comin' back

It goes without sayin', she put me in the past

That train left the station, she didn't have to tell me why

There she goes without sayin', without sayin' goodbye

Sayin' goodbye



No "See you around"

No "It's not you, it's me"

No long, drawn out

She kept it short and not so sweet



And it goes without sayin', she ain't comin' back

It goes without sayin', she put me in the past

And that train left the station, she didn't have to tell me why

There she goes without sayin', without sayin' goodbye

Goes without sayin'

Goes without sayin'

Without sayin' goodbye
