Laugh It Off

When we was lyin' down on the floor

You said I should smile more

I was killin' your vibe

Pretend I didn't hear your voice

But, baby, I was takin' notes

Keep that in mind



Hey, you say you hate me

Ha-ha-ha, I laugh it off

Your mind is made and I can't change it

Someho-ho-how



Haven't seen the sun in a month

But it's all sunshine

I forgot how to cry

It feels like pain, pain is a world away

Took my cigarettes and flushed them down the drain

Now, okay, okay, I'm lyin'



Mm, hey, you say you hate me

Ha-ha-ha, I laugh it off

Your mind is made and I can't change it

Someho-ho-how, I laugh it off



And if I learned anything at all

Smile



Talk to me, I know it's over

I'll listen like I did before



Hey, you say you hate me

Ha-ha-ha, I laughed it off

When I fuck up like I have lately

Someho-ho-how, I laugh it off



And if I learned anything at all

Smile, smile

And if I learned anything at all

Smile, smile



Ooh-ooh

Oh

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
