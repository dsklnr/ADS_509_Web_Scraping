Wrong Ones

Lift kit on a limousine, I got

Ten problems down in Tennessee, and I

Ain't got the time to fix 'em all

Skipped breakfast at Tiffany's for a

Little sermon with Bethany

Now I'm sittin' at a bar on 17th, and I'm gone



With them cold ones comin'

And that smoke fillin' up my lungs

I got fuck-you money, girl

Come on and get you some

And it's hard to walk a straight line

When they curvin' up them jeans

I'm just lookin' for the right one

But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me



Straight outta Louisian', I'm a

Bad boy, real good man, got a

Six-pack and a farmer's tan, top of the world

I can't help that they wanna glance

Ain't one that don't wanna dance

Bunch of cowboys sayin', "Please don't take the girl"



Keep them cold ones comin'

And that smoke fillin' up my lungs

I got country money, honey

Come on and get you some

And it's hard to walk a straight line

The way they curvin' up them jeans

I'm just lookin' for the right one

But them wrong ones keep lookin' at me
