Part Of Me

Once upon a time in the land of necks, where the streets are paved with hillbilly pricks

If you don't look the same, then you are fair game, but the wild inside can never be tamed



And it never will, so I still kill for the thrill

Punk-ass motherfucker dies like that 'cause they never chill

Blood on the ground and remains

Never found, poor fools - never knew what hit em



And so the aforementioned fuckers tried to hit me

In their four by four but they still didn't get me

Jumped through the air with their eight eyes on me, I stared back - then they wouldn't face me



Out of the window, I saw the shotgun

At that moment, they thought that I'd run

But it didn't happen, so the necks were snapping

As my wrath fell down upon them by the ton



Die, fuck, die



Fool



Spine crushed, motherfuckers dead

Snap, crackle, pop drank from their head

Quick turn, search for the three



Disemboweled, made them part of me



Part of



Part of me

You've become part of me
