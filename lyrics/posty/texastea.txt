Texas Tea

Ah-ah

Ah-ah-ah



'83 Caddy with the big-square body and the wheels got tucked in

Chewin' on a cigarette, lookin' at me funny, "What the fuck you smokin'?"

Pop a Tommy collar, and I pop a couple mushies, and I let that shit soak in

Walk into the party, and my neck is on Bugatti, whole bitch got frozen



(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Got them Lucchese boots on my feet

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Punch the gas 'til my leg falls asleep

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) And you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah), uh, mm



Watch skeleton, baby wanna bone me

Record companies really tryna clone me

Got these motherfuckers singin' karaoke

No one's Ginuwine, but they gon' ride my pony

Show the titties off, everybody notice me

Yeah, I'm very pretty, everybody wanna see

And I'm pretty used to everybody oglin'

Now I got that bitch yodelin' in bed, I do



(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Twenty necklaces on, guillotine

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Call me daddy, she from Abilene

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) And you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah), uh, mm

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Pour me something that's taller than me

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Ecstasy when the drink hits my teeth

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) And you know how it goes, ain't it sweet?

(Hah-hah, hah-hah) Texas tea (Hah-hah, hah-hah)
