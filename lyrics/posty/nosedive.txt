Nosedive

I found God lookin' for the devil

Chasin' a high I couldn't keep forever

It's always worse before the better, I suppose

And how far down, it's hard to tell

When to buy and when to sell

'Cause that comedown, it hurts like hell

And every thorn has its rose



Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'

Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive

Sometimes you're runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'

Sometimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive



I hit rock and dropped the shovel

Clawed my way out past the rubble

Do my best, stay outta trouble, heaven knows

Sometimes, the picture, it ain't perfect

But there's learnin' in the hurtin'

Sick of bearin' all the burden

Every thorn has its rose



Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'

Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive

Sometimes you're runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'

Sometimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive



On my descent, the turbulence is my best friend

Buckle up and enjoy the ride

I cut my line through pale blue sky

To remind me I'm alive



Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'

Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive

Sometimes you're runnin', sometimes you're crawlin'

Sometimes you're broke, sometimes you're ballin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive



Sometimes you're drivin', sometimes you're stallin'

Sometimes you're flyin', sometimes you're fallin'

But there's still beauty in the nosedive
