Losers

Last-callers, last-chancers

Nine-to-fivers, truckers, dancers

Couple Chuck's, Ern's, and Chandler's

With a whole lotta prayers unanswered

Whiskey by noon, and beer before that

Southbound train on a hell-bound track

Might just put two middle fingers up and throw one back for all the

People who ain't ever felt at home

Just spinnin' on a rock and gettin' stoned



Yeah, this one's for the losers

The outcasts and the sinners

The ain't never been no winners

Let's hear it for the losers

Ain't got nowhere to fit in

There's a place you can always get in

Oh

You might be lonely but you're never alone

You're right here where you're supposed to be

Right here with all the losers

The one's like you

And the one's like me



My therapist is a good bartender

Heart breakers and two-month benders

Bad times that we can't forget and

Good times that we won't remember

Raise 'em up when we hear a sad song

Love the cry of a steel guitar

No way to change the way we are



This one's for the losers

The outcasts and the sinners

The ain't never been no winners

Let's hear it for the losers

Ain't got nowhere to fit in

There's a place you can always get in

Oh, oh

You might be lonely but you're never alone

You're right here where you're supposed to be

Right here with all the losers

The one's like you

And the one's like me



If you're livin' like you got nothin' to lose



There's a spot for you beside me on this stool



Come kick it with the losers

The outcasts and the sinners

The ain't never been no winners

Let's hear it for the losers

Ain't got nowhere to fit in

There's a place you can always get in

Yeah, oh

You might be lonely but you're never alone

You're right here where you're supposed to be

Right here with all the losers

The one's like you

And the one's like me
