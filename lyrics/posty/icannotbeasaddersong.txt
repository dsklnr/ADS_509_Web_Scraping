I Cannot Be (A Sadder Song)

How am I free when you hold me so tight?

How can I beam when you blocking my light?

I cannot be, what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be



How can I see when you cover my eyes?

And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?

So tell me right now what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be



Yeah, ooh, what you wanna do is tell me off, no

What you wanna do is fuck me up, ooh

What you not gonna do is top me off

So excuse me for an hour while I love myself



You told me, you'd protect my heart, you'd be my goalie

Thinking 'bout the bullshit that you sold me

And I know that I ain't perfect, but you so mean

We were homies



You trip me up just to watch me fall

Smoke another cigarette, wash the last one down

So down, down till I'm flat on my face

You're the reason why I get so high



How am I free when you hold me so tight?

How can I beam when you blocking my light?

I cannot be, what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be



How can I see when you cover my eyes?

And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?

So tell me right now what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be



Got a custom diamond ring

And no, he don't got a wife

Got a large amount things, I can't total the price

I told her I don't need her, she can leave out my life (Life)

You only get one try, but if it's lit, we go twice (Twice)



Uh, pull up in a hard top, it's a drop top (Top)

Told you we'd be multimillionaires, why lie? (Lie)

She know I do not care for no pressin' my mind

The federal skeleton on my wrist say prime-time (Time)

How couldn't you just let me be me

You starting to be measly (Measly)

I couldn't even find out 'cause you leaving me (Me)

You can tell I'm pure, you feel my energy (Energy)

Really rich, we ain't living free

Got to keep it solid

And we all agree



How am I free when you hold me so tight?

How can I beam when you blocking my light?

I cannot be, what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be



How can I see when you cover my eyes?

And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?

So tell me right now what you want me

What you want me, what you want me to be
