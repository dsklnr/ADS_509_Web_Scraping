[Post Malone:]

My momma called, see you on TV, son

Said shit done changed ever since we was on

I dreamed it all ever since I was young

They said I would be nothing

Now they always say, "Congratulations" (uh)

Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (uh-huh)

They ain't never had the dedication (uh)

People hatin', say we changed and, look, we made it (uh)

Yeah, we made it (uh)



They was never friendly, yeah

Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah

And I know I sound dramatic, yeah

But I know I had to have it, yeah

For the money, I'm a savage, yeah

I be itching like a addict, yeah

I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah

But they didn't know me last year, yeah

Everyone wanna act like they important (yeah)

But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah (yeah)

Everyone counting on me, drop the ball, yeah (yeah)

Everything custom like I'm at the border, yah, yah

If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky

How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?

Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side

Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
