Liberate

Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness

I just want to

Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness



Section off myself

Put a wall up

What the hell have I done

Keep the dog at bay

Survive by saving me!

Values and the game

Not a fuck-up

Not a part of your lie

I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond!



Stand off of the shit

Back off or I'll spit

So soft, you forget

Your garbage in is garbage out

You don't give a shit

I won't play the fit

Get off, get on this

Your garbage in is garbage out



Liberate my madness



Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness

I just want to

Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness



I am not ashamed

What is vital isn't always humane

You can break in vain

But you can't break away

Even in my face

Lot of bullshit, not a lotta the truth

I can't see from here

But I can smell your fear



Back off of the shit

Stand off or I'll spit

So soft, you forget

Your garbage in is garbage out

You don't give a shit

I won't play the fit

Get off, get on this

Your garbage in is garbage out



Saved

You're such a slave

I don't expect a name

You don't care

I wasn't a witness

I can't be a part of a system such as this



Hard eyes

Glow right

In my darkness again

With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters

Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness

Fuck this

How long have I had this?

I don't need this

Outta my business

Insert, engage, betrayed, my God

Fraud

Fraud

Fraud



Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness

I just want to

Liberate my madness

(One of me, all of you)

Liberate my madness
