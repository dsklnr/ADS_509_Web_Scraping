Spoil My Night

[Post Malone:]

I don't have much to say, I'll be out front

Won't you come spoil my night?

Feelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time


[Swae Lee:]

Spoil my night, spoil my night

Spoil my night (my night)

Spoil my night, spoil my night



My necklace had a natural glow

She dancin' in the strobe

Let's fuckin' spoil my night (spoil my night)

Spent so much cash, I lost her

My cup was too toxic

I took the robe off (yeah)

I couldn't get her off me

Dropped plenty money on her thighs

There's plenty room in my ride

I've never been like a small fry

She took me in, that's on my life



Spoil my night, spoil my night

Spoil my night (my night)

Spoil my night, spoil my night

Yeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me

Then I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (ooh)

Point her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)

I ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (wow)

And she see those diamonds in my teeth (in my teeth)

I see her smilin' back at me (back at me)

I think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)

It's about time, Postmate Plan B

Now she whippin' out her phone and I know (and I know)

Damn, how many videos you gon' post?

Everybody on the 'Gram gonna know

My girl at home now my line about to blow (yeah)

I know what I'm doin' ain't right

But ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need

Spoil my night, spoil my night
