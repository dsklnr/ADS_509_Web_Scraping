Landmine

Ooh-ah, ah



And all my friends

Take vitamins

Break off perfect pieces

With violence



And outside

I'm burnin' my way through a stoplight

Baby, I'm fine

I'm just workin' my way through a deadline



And all my friends

Invite 'em in

And my cigarette

And hope someone's watchin'

And to be honest, I fumble for the thrill of it

Innocent, militant-like



And outside

I'm burnin' my way through a stoplight

Baby, I'm fine

I'm just thumbin' my way through a landmine



And if you're gettin' sick of it

Imagine how I must feel

But if you're gettin' rid of it

Then maybe I'll just keep some myself



And outside

I'm burnin' my way through a stoplight

Baby, I'm fine

I'm just thumbin' my way through a landmine

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
